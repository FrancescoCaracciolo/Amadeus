Nakabachi: Who the hell are you?

Okabe: 
Unhand me, you... huh?

???: 

Kurisu: Could you come with me for a moment?
Huh?
Stop fooling around and come with me.

Okabe: Try anything and people are sure to notice. What will your superiors say then?

Kurisu: I just need to ask you something.
What's with this 'Organization' stuff?

Okabe: It's me. I've been caught by an Organization agent. ...Yes, it's Makise Kurisu. She's a dangerous one. ...No, it's fine. I'll find a way to--

Kurisu: 

Okabe: What are you doing!?

Kurisu: Huh? Your phone's off.
...Who were you talking to?

Okabe: Y-your techniques don't work on me, but I'll tell you anyway. That's no ordinary phone. It's designed to deactivate the moment it leaves my hand. Muhahaha!

Kurisu: So you talk to yourself.
What were you trying to tell me earlier?
You were trying to tell me something, right? You looked really upset.
And how do you know my name?

Daru: So basically, you're just pulling stuff outta your ass. You can't call that science.

???: Ah!

Okabe: Wha...!?
You... you...!

Kurisu: Is there something wrong?
O-ow!

Okabe: Not a scratch...

Kurisu: What's wrong with you?

Daru: That again?

Kurisu: Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I'm perfectly fine.

Daru: You know, that message was kinda weird. It was dated a week after I got it, which means it came from the future.

Kurisu: It came from the future?

Daru: No, the date was definitely a week later. It came from, uh... the 28th. Wait. That's today!

Okabe: This is the email I sent you three hours ago.

Kurisu: Interesting...

Okabe: Substance. She has substance. Of course she's not a ghost. How silly of me.

Kurisu: 

Daru: O-Okarin, I don't think that's a good idea...

Kurisu: Hey.
Are you trying to get yourself arrested?
What truth, you perv!? You stupid!? Wanna die!?


Okabe: I know what I saw!

Kurisu: No way! Did you just see my underw...!?
...
Wait. Doctor Nakabachi?

Daru: What are you talking about, Okarin? Doctor Nakabachi's presentation was canceled.

Kurisu: Excuse me, um...

Daru: Really, man? You're hopeless...


Professor: Makise-san? It's almost time.

Kurisu: Huh? Oh, right. Thank you.

Daru: We should go too.
To hear the lecture, duh?

Kurisu: Um, I'd like to thank everyone for coming to hear me speak today.
For today's lecture, I've been asked to speak on the subject of time travel. It's not really my area of expertise, but I'll try my best.

Okabe: OBJECTION!

Kurisu: Hwa...!?
Um... okay. It's fine, I guess. It'll be easier to talk in a discussion format.
Scientists have proposed many theoretical models of time travel, but there are eleven in particular that bear mentioning.
Neutron Star Theory. Black Hole Theory. Lightspeed Theory.
Tachyon Theory. Wormhole Theory. Exotic Matter Theory.
Cosmic String Theory. Quantum Gravity Theory. Cesium Laser Theory.
Elementary Particle Ring & Laser Theory. Dirac Antiparticle Theory.

Okabe: 

Kurisu: Hm? Ahh, uhh, right, well...
It could be contradicted by the 13th model, now couldn't it?

If you were to keep running at that speed for 24 hours, 48 hours would elapse in the rest of the world, meaning you would 'jump' one day into the future. Understand, Hououin Kyouma?
Yes, you're right.

It has immense mass, so it distorts space-time. If you were to travel through that distortion, you could make a full circle around the string in less than 360 degrees.
In short, you can do something resembling a warp. This is called a space-time angular deficit.
When you pass through an area of angular deficit, transit time becomes zero.
Now we apply this to a cosmic string moving at near-light speed.


Yes, that's correct.
There are two wormholes joined by a tunnel. No matter how far away the wormholes are, transit time through the tunnel is zero.
But oh no, there's a problem. The wormhole tunnel suffers from super gravity, and collapses as soon as it opens.
So-called 'exotic matter'. A substance with negative mass which repulses other matter.
Say that the wormhole tunnel is being squished by an invisible fist.
If you stabilize the tunnel with exotic matter injection, instantaneous travel between wormholes becomes possible. To travel through time, however, takes a little more effort.
For example, let's say there's a wormhole entrance here in Akihabara, and the exit is in Los Angeles.

Now do you see what I meant when I said that time travel is an absurd concept?


Okabe: You mean time paradoxes... and conservation of mass?

Kurisu: If you think that conservation of mass applies to macro-systems like the universe or micro-systems like atoms or elementary particles, you're mistaken.
Heh.
Conservation of mass only applies to chemical reactions. It doesn't hold in modern physics at all.

???: Oh?
That looks like an interesting experiment.


Daru: Nice exposition, bro.

Kurisu: Who are you calling a zombie?
I'm here to see you, Okabe Rintaro-san. Or is it Hououin Kyouma-san?

Okabe: I was right! You're one of the Organization's top agents, an esper with superhuman powers!

Kurisu: I'm not dead, alright? Please stop killing me off.

Daru: You came at a bad time, Makise-shi, with Okarin freaking out like this.
Calm down, man.

Okabe: YOU'VE CROSSED THE LINE, BIIITTCH!

Kurisu: Get ahold of yourself.
Hashida-san gave me the address after yesterday's lecture. He also told me your name.

Okabe: So you're here to see me, is that it?

Kurisu: Yes. You claimed to have seen me die. I came to see if that was the truth, or just a pathetic excuse to grope me. I came for the answer.
But your current behavior is all the answer I need. It was all an act to grope me. My initial hypothesis was correct.

Okabe: Not so fast. There's more to this than you know.

Kurisu: Anyway, let's put that aside for now.

Okabe: R-really?

Kurisu: I haven't properly introduced myself yet, have I? I'm Makise Kurisu. Pleased to meet you.
You can't even shake hands? Are all Japanese men this difficult?

Okabe: You're not Japanese!?

Kurisu: I've lived in America for seven years. What about it?

Okabe: America...

Kurisu: What's your problem?

Okabe: I can feel your aura of malice. You must be a powerful kung-fu master.

Kurisu: Don't be ridiculous.

Okabe: Then you're a NINJA--

Kurisu: Give it a rest.

Okabe: If you grew up in America, shouldn't you say 'HAHAHA! NICE TO MEET YOU!' with a smile across your whole face when asking for a handshake?
No, wait, you should be asking for a hug, right?

Kurisu: What kind of stereotype is that?
...Fascinating.
Have any forceps?

Okabe: No!
What are you doing!? That's precious data!

Kurisu: It's squishy.
...No taste. Gross.

Okabe: You have quite the appetite, I see. A side-effect of the resurrection, perhaps? If you're that hungry, I guess I could give you a banana or two!

Kurisu: No thanks.

Daru: Either way, those bananas are Mayushii's.

Okabe: Come, don't be shy. This is an offering. Take it!

Kurisu: As if. Who would eat some perv's banana?

Daru: A perv's banana...!
Eat... a perv's banana... squishy... finger in mouth... 'Gross!' with a sour expression...
Um, can you say that one more time? With a more humiliated expression, if you please.

Kurisu: Huh?

Daru: Come on. Say, 'Who would eat some perv's banana?' but if you could add an, 'Ahh, but it's so...' after that, it would be extra delicious!

Kurisu: Huh? ...huh?
...Ah!!

Okabe: Muhaha! Oh, Daru. You may be a worthless, disgusting perv, but let me say, well done, sir!
So, Makise Kurisu. You just imagined something, didn't you? By all means, tell us what. Don't be shy. Muhahaha!

Kurisu: Why you...

Okabe: Come on! Say it, genius girl! What's the imagination of a genius like? I'd love to hear from you!

Kurisu: You... ass!



Okabe: I don't want to hear that from you.

Kurisu: Okay! If I came off as a little rude, I apologize.
I was only acting that way because you molested me, but I'll ignore that for now.
Please tell me what happened to this banana. I'd also like to hear about that...
That microwave thing.

Okabe: That's top secret. The one thing I'm cleared to share with unauthorized individuals is that its name is the PhoneWave (name subject to change).

Kurisu: Name subject to change? What's that about?

Okabe: PhoneWave is weak. It needs a better name.

Kurisu: I couldn't care less about its name.

Okabe: I'm afraid that's the only information you're cleared for.

Daru: Hold on, Okarin. Makise-shi might be able to explain what's going on.

Okabe: Hmm... well...

Kurisu: That creepy grin... are you thinking perverted thoughts again?

Okabe: You said your name's Christina, right?

Kurisu: Who the hell's Christina!? I never said that!

Okabe: If you wish to learn the secrets of this microwave, then you must meet my conditions.

Kurisu: Which are?


Kurisu: Ramen?

Okabe: No! Lab mem, stupid! Short for laboratory member!

Kurisu: You mean you want me to join your research team? I'm supposed to return to America in August.

Okabe: I'll have you sign a non-disclosure agreement so you won't betray our secrets. Break the agreement, and I'll report your steamy, perverted acts to Science Magazine.

Kurisu: Gh...

Daru: You're a monster, Okarin. I'll take five copies.

Okabe: From the moment you become a lab mem to the moment of your departure, your brain shall be used for the benefit of our lab.

Kurisu: You're so full of it. Let's see the contract, then.

Okabe: What contract? This is a lab, not a corporation!

Kurisu: I don't mind lending you my knowledge, but if there is more pervy nonsense involved, the answer is NO.

Okabe: Don't worry, we don't bite.

Kurisu: No more molestation?

Okabe: No, alright!?

Kurisu: You said that was condition one. So there's gotta be a second one, right? It better not be--

Okabe: The second condition is...
That you'll overlook all past acts of molestation I may or may not have committed!

Kurisu: 

Okabe: Shut up, Daru. You have no right to talk. By the way, Daru's perverted acts aren't included. You two can work it out yourselves.

Daru: What the hell, man!

Okabe: Those are the conditions! If you can't accept them, then you must leave at once!
Heh heh heh. So what'll it be? I don't think it's a bad deal at all.

Kurisu: You mean for you.


Okabe: I don't care about your dislocated jaw! Do you accept the conditions or not? Answer me, Christina!

Kurisu: Stop adding -tina! My name's Kurisu!
...Okay. I accept.
I won't answer to either. Use my real name, Hououin.
You're such a child.
Come on! No more saying 'perv'! I won't treat you like a perv either! So let's drop it already!
No '-tina' either.

Okabe: Give Kurisu-kun an explanation on our experiments so far.


Okabe: 

Kurisu: Fascinating.

Can we run the experiment one more time? I want to see it for myself.
Okabe-san, Hashida-san, please watch the bananas.
Whatever. Just keep your eye on the bananas!
Sixty seconds have passed. Any change?

Daru: Nope.
Ah!

Kurisu: 
Huh? Oh... uh...
...

Did it really teleport? It's dangerous to reason from the conclusion.
...
Let's sort this out.

Daru: That's quite a lot, then.

Kurisu: What about salt? You experimented with salt too, right?
Maybe the plate was in the way.
Then, maybe each individual grain of salt was too small... or something?
Hmm... I need a clue...
Forget about that.

Daru: Oh, right!
One time, it shot off a huge electrical discharge.

Okabe: What!? I don't know anything about that!

Daru: Around noon yesterday. When you went to see Doctor Nakabachi's presentation.

Kurisu: Doctor Nakabachi...

Okabe: But wait, Daru. Didn't you say that Doctor Nakabachi's presentation was cancelled?

Kurisu: That email you showed me at ATF yesterday?
It said someone stabbed me at the presentation, didn't it?

Daru: Huh? Wasn't that one of your stories? If it wasn't, then that would make the timestamp weird.

Okabe: It's gone...

Daru: Oh yeah! That's when the discharge phenomenon happened! The show I was watching was about to end.

Kurisu: Uh, what?

Daru: Oh, this is one of Okarin's usual habits, so don't mind it. Seriously.

Okabe: The disappearance of my mail, the strange timestamp, and the sudden electrical discharge must be...

Daru: 

Kurisu: And?
Hashida-san, talking to this guy's so tiring.

Mayuri: You all want some? I can give you one each.

Okabe: So, we've reproduced the conditions that existed when the discharge phenomenon occurred. Right?

Daru: Uhh, how was it again...

Kurisu: Huh? Me?
When did I become your assistant!?
Don't call me your assistant!

Daru: Uh, sure... but what?
Uhh, umm...

Kurisu: I thought we agreed to stop saying that!

Daru: Well, let's compromise and go with 'Okarin's a perv'.

Kurisu: Good job, Hashida-san!

Mayuri: Oh no! Mayushii's bananas!

Kurisu: We experimented on them.

Daru: Want me to send the mail now?

Kurisu: You'll be reimbursed later. By Hououin-san, that is.

Daru: 'Kay, sending it now. Sending, sending, click.

Okabe: Wait! Don't open that!

Mayuri: Huh?
Wawah!

Kurisu: An electrical discharge!

Daru: Are we gonna die!?

Okabe: E-everyone okay?
Are you okay? No burns or anything?

Kurisu: H-hey! Look at this!

Okabe: Heh... heh heh heh... MUHAHAHA! Just as my calculations predicted!

Daru: So, about Mayu-shi's chicken.

Mayuri: Eh?
Ahh! M-Mayushii's chicken is all burnt black...

Kurisu: The chicken doesn't matter! Right now, we need to determine what happened with the Phonewa--

Mayuri: It doesn't matter? That's so mean, uh, Christina-chan...

Kurisu: Hey, Hououin Kyouma! Do something about this! Mayushii-san learned my name wrong!

Daru: More importantly, we need ventilation. *cough cough*

Okabe: Muhaha! Muhahaha! MUHAHAHAHA!
This isn't intuition. That's right. This is conviction!

Kurisu: Just spit it out. What do you think it is?
...No way.

Okabe: Is a time machine!

Daru: 

Kurisu: A time machine? A time machine!? It can't be!!

Mayuri: I feel like I can reach the stars.

Okabe: It's too early for stars, Mayuri.

Mayuri: Did you know? Even during the day, the stars are still up there.
Ehehe! That's true.

Kurisu: Ah.

Okabe: Well, if it isn't my assistant. What are you doing here?

Kurisu: Hey. When did I become your assistant?
...Why are you glaring at me?

Okabe: Don't worry about it. You're not the cause of my frustration.

Kurisu: Oh, so you're just raging? Don't glare at me.
That's because you keep doing pervy--
Ah, no, I'm not saying anything.
Are the emails you're getting really that unpleasant?

Okabe: So, Christina, what brings you here?

Kurisu: If you're going to call me names, could you at least be consistent?
I'm not pouting. I just don't want to get involved in your silly games again.

Okabe: Did you come to see the satellite?

Kurisu: I guess.
It doesn't make sense. Normally, they calculate satellites' orbits so that they burn up in the atmosphere when they fall. So how can that thing be in such perfect condition?
They still don't know. Rumors say it's from the former Soviet Union, but Russia denies it. So it looks like they can't remove it yet.
Organization? What's that?

...
Just answer me. Have you learned anything?
Hello? Can you put your phone away when you're talking with someone?

Okabe: Don't be like that. Rather, you should praise me, for I have taught a foul mail demon to behave like a civilized human being.

Kurisu: Why are you so pompous?
...
Are you done with your little mail exchange? Hououin-san?
I was being facetious.
This is exhausting...
You're pompous, but at least you have some manners.
I hate people who play with their phones in the middle of a conversation.
When we first met? I didn't do that.
What? What do you mean 'giving your report'?

Okabe: So, about the PhoneWave (name subject to change).
After the experiment, you screamed something like 'A time machine? It can't be!' Did something awaken a past trauma?

Kurisu: No. And don't go making one up either.
I wasn't hit by lightning! And I was still living in Japan when I was five! And why Arkansas?
Not Utah? I mean, relatively speaking, isn't Utah more suitable?
...No reason. I simply didn't want to believe. Fringe science should stay in the realm of fiction.
And yet a bunch of amateurs like you just stick a phone and a microwave together and expect time travel to occur? Ridiculous.
Wait, are you rejecting modern physics? Who do you think you are?
So you're going to do nothing, just because you could be wrong? Then enjoy your dirty little lab and your silly gadgets, because that's all you'll ever have.
...What?
I don't know what to say unless you can give me some examples.
The occult? Really?
...
No.
My father, a physicist, loved time machines. He was so fascinated by Wells's 'The Time Machine' that he seriously studied time travel.
But because of his obsession, he was practically exiled from the scientific community.

...I'm sorry. I got emotional.
...Huh?
...Anyway, the PhoneWave isn't a time machine.
...
Don't call me Christina.
You look ridiculous!

Okabe: What are you doing!? You've ruined my perfectly-staged exit scene! And you call yourself my assistant!?

Kurisu: No, I don't call myself your assistant! And besides, I still have something to ask you!
I asked you about this before, but you said I got stabbed, right? I demand an explanation.
Why would you dream about me?
You said something about Doctor Nakabachi, didn't you?
I don't flirt. Especially not with idiots like you.
Escapism? That's unexpectedly chicken of you.
So who stabbed me? Don't tell me it was you.
My hero.
...I've heard enough. No more hallucinating about me, okay? Dying isn't fun, even if it's in someone else's head.
You have a comeback for everything, don't you.
Kyah! What now!?

Okabe: I'm not done talking!

Kurisu: You trying to pick a fight?
Okay, okay, fine. What is it?
Hey! Don't tell me to forget about it!
What is the IBN five... whatever?
...

...Great. I shouldn't have asked.

Okabe: It's me. Report the situation.
No, she didn't tell me anything.
What!? Faris!?
This too is the choice of Steins Gate!
So, is Faris there?


Okabe: She donated it... to a shrine?
Whatever. It's a lead.
I see. Daru, I'm sure you can do it. Be sure to win.
Who is this?
You're from the Organization, aren't you? Is this a warning? You telling me to stop getting involved with SERN?
You're not from the Organization?
Makise...
Oh! My assistant!
If you don't say Christina, then I have no way of knowing it's you.
You never stop complaining, do you?
Wait a minute. How do you know my phone number?
Oh, that's boring. So, what is it, assistant?
I'm headed to Yanabayashi Shrine.
...

Kurisu: 
I just wanted to ask you where you were. And since you said you were coming here, I came.
...

Okabe: Why did you come to see me?

Kurisu: 
...I can't stop thinking about what you said yesterday.

Okabe: What I said?

Kurisu: About the IBN 5100. And SERN.

Okabe: Of course! You're working for SERN, not the Organization! You're here to kill me, aren't you!? That's what I thought! You have the face of a killer!

Kurisu: What's wrong with my face? How rude!
Can you calm down a bit? You're always screwing around. I can't believe you're older than me.

Okabe: Calm down? Hmph! You don't understand what it's like to live on the run, never knowing when the next assassin will strike.

Kurisu: All I'm hearing is gibberish.

Okabe: You come here to pick a fight?

Kurisu: I just want to know how the IBN 5100 and SERN are related.

Okabe: Don't you mean you're interested in SERN's time machine research? Be honest with yourself.

Kurisu: Sh-shut up. I'm not interested in time machines at all.
More importantly, did you find an IBN 5100?


Kurisu: A shrine?

Luka: I'm sorry, but, it gets in the way when I'm cleaning, so...

Okabe: What if they attack while you're cleaning? Nobody's going to come to your rescue, you know.

Luka: Th-that's true... I'll be more careful from now on.

Kurisu: Hey. What are you two talking about?

Luka: Um... who might this be?

Okabe: My assistant.

Kurisu: No! What kind of introduction is that!?

Okabe: I'm only telling the truth, Christina.

Luka: You're n-not Japanese?

Kurisu: I am Japanese.

Okabe: Anyway, Lukako. I need to talk to your father about--

Kurisu: Wait! Introduce me properly!

An introduction wouldn't take more than ten seconds! What's wrong with you?

Luka: Um... please don't fight...

Okabe: This is Makise Kurisu. My assistant.

Kurisu: Yeah, whatever. Assistant, whatever... sigh.

Luka: Nice to meet you, Makise-san. I'm Urushibara L-Luka.

Kurisu: Nice to meet you too. How old are you?

Luka: Oh, really? Makise-san, you're so grown up, I can't believe we're only a year apart.

Okabe: That means you look old.

Kurisu: 

Luka: No, that's not what I... um, I mean you're very beautiful!

Kurisu: Thanks. I think you're very cute.

Okabe: You're introduced. Happy? Can we move on now?

Kurisu: You are such a jerk.

Luka: 
The future...

Kurisu: Of mankind?

Luka: I'll go get him!

Kurisu: Achoo!
Oh no, did I catch a cold?

Luka's Father: Ah, Hououin-kun. It's been a while. Thank you for always taking care of Luka.

Kurisu: I'm just telling the truth.

Luka's Father: Luka told me his name was Hououin. Hmm, maybe Luka was just playing a trick on me. Hahaha.

Luka: Th-that's not it, Dad. Okabe-san is his real name, and Hououin is, umm...

Kurisu: Okabe Rintaro is the name your parents gave you, right? Are you denying that?
Who's a zombie!?

Luka's Father: Hahaha. It's great that you all get along.

Kurisu: Um, I'm...

Luka: C-come on, Dad...

Kurisu: 
...

Okabe: An IBN 5100...!

Luka: Ah, look at this.

Okabe: 
Urushibara-shi. I'll be blunt.
Can't Americans start driving at 16? How come you don't have a license?

Kurisu: I thought so too, until I met you. Now I realize I'm doing just fine.

Luka: Umm, no fighting please...

Kurisu: Your father is a lovely man.

Luka: Eh...
M-my father is m-married... a-ad-adultery... is bad!

Kurisu: Huh?
Hey, wait! Don't misunderstand, you two. That's not what I meant!

Luka: I-I won't give up my father...
Eh, ah, of course... I'm sorry for the weird misunderstanding! That was so rude of me!

Kurisu: Don't cry. We've resolved the misunderstanding, so it's all okay.
Die.

Okabe: Lukako, don't forget your practice swings with Samidare.

Luka: Y-yes sir. I'll do my best... Umm, El Psy Kongalee...
I'm sorry!

Kurisu: Hey! What kind of lowlife teases a girl?

Okabe: Hng! ...Gah, it's heavy!

Luka: Is it that heavy?

Kurisu: Wheugh...!
...It's r-really heavy.
This thing's gotta weigh like 30 kilos.
Maybe we should've borrowed a push cart. Urushibara-san, is there one in the shrine?

Luka: Umm, there is one, but actually, it's broken... I'm sorry.

Kurisu: Then how are you going to bring it back? It takes about ten minutes to walk to your run-down lab from here.
So that's why...
But I refuse.
I... I said 'no!'
Sh-shut up. I said no.
The whole reason you made me a lab mem was to 'borrow my knowledge'. From this, it is elementary to derive the following: 'I won't do physical labor.'

Okabe: I see. Then I guess I have no choice. I'll do my best to carry it, but...

Luka: Um, th-then, I will...

Kurisu: Eh? You're going to help? Will you be okay?

Okabe: No, Lukako. I shouldn't make you help me. I can manage by myself.

Kurisu: Th-then, umm... me too...

Okabe: Please, go ahead.

Kurisu: Eh? Wha!?
You sneaky...

Okabe: Thanks for the backup, Lukako! Now that that's settled, my assistant will help me carry the computer, so you don't have to help. Thanks for the offer.

Luka: Ah, okay... if that's how it is, then...

Kurisu: Fine.
Why do we have to be face to face?
Hey! Stop stop stop! I said stop!

Okabe: You're a noisy one.

Kurisu: Hey, listen, please, just listen! I can't walk backwards!
I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I can't! I'm asking you to go sideways! No, I'm telling you to go sideways! Sideways! I'm going to fall!
Haah, we finally made it... I'm exhausted...
Right back at you. You stopped to take a break at least five times along the way.
Are you okay?
Shut up, or I'll tear the peripheral nerves out of that arm.
Shouldn't you get your friends to help?

Suzuha: Huh?

Kurisu: Wait! If you're just going to stand and talk, shouldn't we put the box down first?

Suzuha: Well? What is it?
No way! You found it!? Wow! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro!
Where was it?

Kurisu: Haah...

Suzuha: So, where was it?
Yanabayashi Shrine? You mean like a Shinto shrine?
Ah...!

Kurisu: Y-yes?

Suzuha: 

Kurisu: What is it? Have I done something wrong?

Suzuha: Hmph.

Kurisu: Who was that?
Why was she glaring at me?
I've never seen her before in my life. How rude.

Okabe: Good work, everyone. With this, we can fight.

Kurisu: Who are you fighting?


Mayuri: Okarin? I don't want you doing bad things, remember?

Daru: But wow! I can't believe you found one. You make the impossible look easy! That's why we love you! That's why we ad--

Kurisu: I certainly don't admire him.

Daru: Eh?

Kurisu: Eh...?

Mayuri: It's all thanks to Mayushii!
Without Mayushii's info, Okarin would still be lost on the streets of Akiba.
Ehehe! Anyway, it's time for Mayushii to go home.

Kurisu: Thanks. But I'm going to stay here a little longer.

Luka: Ugh! I-it's heavy!
Ugh, ugghhh...
Haah... haah... we made it...
Ah, no...
Since you're my master, Kyouma-san, I'm happy... to be of use to you.

Okabe: Come forth, my servants! By the covenant I command thee, grant me thy power!

Luka: K-Kyouma-san!?

Kurisu: You're so annoying! What is it!?

Suzuha: Wait... you got one?
No way! Amazing! Way to go, Okabe Rintaro! Where did you find it?
Yanbayashi Shrine? You mean, like a Shinto shrine?

Mayuri: Oh! So that's why Luka-kun's with you.

Luka: Y-yeah...

Kurisu: What's this? What're you talking about?

Luka: Um, the IBN... two thousand... five thousand... what was it?

Kurisu: Oh, that thing you were talking about yesterday.

Suzuha: Ah...!

Kurisu: Y-yes?

Suzuha: 

Kurisu: What is it? Have I done something to you?
Who was that?

Mayuri: Oh, she works part-time at the Braun Tube Workshop. Her name's Suzu-san!
You do?

Kurisu: Why was she glaring at me like that?
I've never seen her before in my life. How rude.

Okabe: Anyway, help me out here. We're taking this thing into the lab.
Hey! Why didn't you help!?

Daru: Well, you didn't call me.

Kurisu: Haah, haah... why do I... have to...

Luka: Thank you! I'm so happy!

Mayuri: Ehehe! Really? I'm glad I was useful.

Kurisu: What are you going to use the IBN 5100 for? Yesterday you said something about SERN.
I'm not Christina, and I'm not interested. If you don't want to tell me, then I don't really care.
War? SERN's a research institution.
...What are you trying to do? Depending on the situation, I could turn you over to the police, you know?
You can't be serious. Tell me what you're trying to do.

Daru: Hmm... well...
Wow, it actually turned on.
First I need to learn how to use this thing. It looks like hooking it up is gonna be a pain.
There's still 30 days left this month. It's not gonna take that long.

Mayuri: We're gonna take off now, okay?

Kurisu: You're so full of yourself.
Thanks. But I'm going to stay here a little longer.

Mayuri: Okay. See you later! Tutturu♪

Luka: Excuse me.

Kurisu: Well?

Okabe: Well, what?

Kurisu: I'm asking for an explanation. What's this about the IBN 5100 and SERN?
Hey, Okabe.

Okabe: What?

Kurisu: I called you O-Okabe.

Okabe: You called me Okabe?

Daru: Time out, time out!


Kurisu: !!
...
No.

Okabe: Are you... crying?

Kurisu: I'm not crying! It's not like I was scared of you for a second there or anything, and I definitely wasn't relieved when you started talking like an idiot again, okay!?

Okabe: Daru, why is my assistant crying?

Daru: Maybe she only acts strong but is actually weak on the inside. That would be pretty moe.

Kurisu: Hey, aren't you going to tell me what's going on?
Kya!

Okabe: I'll explain in a second. Drink that while you wait.
Now then...
Sorry for the wait, Christina.

Kurisu: I've lived seven years at its birthplace, after all.
I'm a minor.
Is that all you drink?
SERN certainly is acting strange... but how's the IBN 5100 involved?

Okabe: Allow me to explain. My trusted Super Hacka, Mister Daru--

Daru: It's not super hacka. How many times do I have to tell you?

Kurisu: Is that okay? Won't they catch you?

Daru: I wouldn't make a blunder like that.

Kurisu: The LHC?

Daru: Seriously. We have the evidence. And guess what? The LHC has been in operation for nine years.

Kurisu: What? Really!?
No way... Then why haven't they made an official announcement!?

Okabe: Basically, it's proof that SERN has something to hide. Can't you just smell the conspiracy?

Kurisu: I don't believe in conspiracies, but...
Ah, but what about the IBN 5100? How is that involved?

Okabe: Sorry. Daru, please continue the explanation.
So, how far did you get?
The only way to decrypt that database is to use an IBN 5100 of our own.

Kurisu: How do you know that?
I want to see proof that SERN's really doing that sort of research.

Daru: Actually, I was just thinking about doing that. It shouldn't take more than half a day, I guess.

Okabe: There you go.

Kurisu: I'll wait until then.

Daru: You'll wait? It's already getting dark. Why not go home for tonight and come back tomorrow morning?

Kurisu: No thanks. I'll wait. I want to know as soon as possible, even if it's just a microsecond sooner.

Okabe: Heh heh heh, that's the spirit. You're already fascinated by the conspiracy. You can't help but want to know what lies at the heart of SERN.

Kurisu: If what you guys are saying is true... then this isn't something to joke about.
SERN is the world's top research institution. If they're doing secret experiments without publishing their results...
They're making fools of scientists the world over.
That's only if it's true, though.

Okabe: Anyway, Daru. I'll leave it to you.

Kurisu: Can you show me the PhoneWave?
Man. You have a ton of junk.
Hey. Isn't this... a weapon?
How confusing.
So it's junk. I thought so.

Okabe: Whoa!

Kurisu: It's just not right without a lab coat.
Hey!
G-get what? Let go!
I don't know if that's supposed to be a compliment, but it's coming off as an insult. Now let go!

Okabe: I'm giving you that lab coat to commemorate your joining the lab. Don't worry. It's never been worn.
Or maybe this fateful encounter between you and that lab coat was decided by destiny long ago. Daru not wearing it was just another inevitability. This is the choice of Steins--

Kurisu: Shut up so we can start the experiment.

Okabe: 

Kurisu: So you haven't tampered with the microwave at all?

Okabe: It's in terminal mode now. We can change the factory settings like this, make the microwave do things its manufacturer never intended.

Kurisu: How was it set when the discharge phenomenon occurred?

Okabe: Nothing out of the ordinary. It was at factory settings.

Kurisu: Hmm.
I'll take a banana.

Okabe: Those are Mayuri's.

Kurisu: Oh, so I don't need your permission, then. I'll go buy new bananas tomorrow.
...Nothing happened.
Ow!
It's hot.

Okabe: Meaning the microwave functioned normally.
What does this mean...

Kurisu: I guess what happened earlier was an irregularity after all.

Okabe: I don't know if it's an irregularity or not, but we ought to investigate the cause.

Kurisu: I agree.

Okabe: In the previous experiment...
After spending 120 seconds in the PhoneWave (name subject to change), the banana teleported back to the bunch gelified. We should consider that it returned to its state 120 seconds before.

Kurisu: Wrong. If it returned to its state 120 seconds before, it wouldn't be gelified.

Okabe: The chicken returned to its frozen state without gelifying.

Kurisu: That logic is dubious. Sure it ended up frozen, but did you examine the possibility that it might have gelified first?

Okabe: Salt didn't gelify.

Kurisu: You mean nothing changed.


Kurisu: Is the microwave storing electricity?
You said that gelified objects became fractal structured, right?
No. It's not good to start thinking from the conclusion.
I'm not especially concerned whether this thing is a time machine or not.
We can't reproduce the discharge phenomenon, nor the fractalization. There should be a reason why.
What do you mean by that?
There were four of us here when the discharge phenomenon occurred last time. But before that, it occurred when Hashida-san was alone.
Hmmm...
...
It's already 8?

Okabe: Or you could take something from our stock of cup noodles.

Kurisu: 

Okabe: Don't want any? Well, since you have lived in America for so long, I guess you'd prefer fast food instead--

Kurisu: Cup noodles.

Okabe: What?

Kurisu: I'll have cup noodles.

Okabe: Cup noodles!?

Kurisu: What flavors?

Okabe: There's soy sauce flavor and chicken flavor.

Kurisu: Chicken.
Also... do you have a fork?

Okabe: Christina, is it okay to stay here this late? Perhaps you should contact your family.

Kurisu: No need.

Okabe: What? Do your parents let you do whatever you want?

Kurisu: I haven't seen my father in seven years. My mother is in America. I'm living in a hotel right now. Understand?

Okabe: Wha...!
You damn celebrity! If you're American, then you should at least use a motel instead of a hotel, right!?

Kurisu: I'm not American, and there aren't any motels in the heart of Tokyo.

Okabe: What sort of hotel?

Kurisu: What do you mean? It's a normal hotel in Ochanomizu.

Okabe: Ochanomizu? Then you can walk there from here, can't you?

Kurisu: Sure.

Okabe: So, tell me about your father.

Kurisu: Sorry?
You're crazy.
...

Okabe: What's wrong?

Kurisu: Don't make fun...

Daru: Mission complete.
I got the server admin's ID and password. Now we can peep as much as we want, hyahoohh!

Okabe: And the IBN 5100 database?

Daru: That's separate, duh. The server admin's unrelated.
I mean, it's a database with normally unreadable code, so there's a limit on who can access it. Doesn't look like even the lab director can access it.
There's something called the SERN Executive Council.
What about it?

Kurisu: 

Daru: Okey-dokey. That Z Program we saw last time was suspicious, wasn't it?

Okabe: Look carefully. And burn it into your eyes. The proof of SERN's actions, its deceit upon the world.

Daru: Oh yeah, baby. Found the LHC project supervisor.
Z Program, Z Program... hmm...

Kurisu: Jelly starts with J. J-E-L-L-Y.

Daru: Pfft, careless mistake. So uncool.

Okabe: Ahem! What I meant to say is that there's no way it would have such a simple name. The name's hiding something important. There has to be a double meaning!

Daru: Got it!
The program began... in 1973.
Ugh, a JPEG? Come on! I can't copypaste this.

Kurisu: Of course not. Stop assigning people roles in your fantasy world.
'In order to maintain this project's secrecy, and to allow its name to remain relevant in changing circumstances, we designate it the Z Program.'

Okabe: Is there anything specific about what exactly the Z Program is?

Kurisu: Hmm... ah... here.

Okabe: What is it?

Kurisu: 'The purpose of the Z Program is to perform time-space displacement experiments by means of high-energy proton-proton collisions.'

Okabe: Time travel!

Kurisu: No way... it was true?
What Organization, you chuunibyou nutjob? At least try to be serious some of the time.

Daru: Anyway, shouldn't it be 'the Committee' instead of 'the Organization'? That's what it says here.


Daru: Listen, Okarin...

Kurisu: You're making things up again.
...Wow. That was quite a speech.
I'm not asking Hououin. I'm asking Okabe.
In other words, you don't have your own reason.

Daru: Forget about him, Makise-shi. Please keep reading.
I'm tired of listening to conspiracy theories. I'm more interested in the Z Program than in your delusions.

Kurisu: At least show respect when you're asking a favor...
Umm...


Daru: For real?
H-hey, Okarin. Remember when we hacked in before? I'm pretty sure that email we read said this...
Could that have something to do with... human experimentation?

Okabe: Daru... look up the Jellyman's Report.

Daru: Really?

Kurisu: Eh?
Why are you suddenly--
...I keep telling you, I'm not your assistant.
But still--
...

Daru: Well, I am a super hacker.


Kurisu: Why Norse mythology?

Daru: Is that Norse mythology? Because it's cool, I guess.
Ready? I'm opening it.

Kurisu: 'Jellyman's Report 10'
...was completely gelified.'

Daru: What's going on here?

Kurisu: They're experimenting on people...

Okabe: SERN...

Daru: So... SERN used the LHC to send someone back to 1921?
No, there's more. Looks like... 14 people in total.

Okabe: Show me the others.

Kurisu: 'Jellyman's Report 9.'
'Jellyman's Report 8.'
'Jellyman's Report 7.'
'Jellyman's Report 6.'

Daru: Keep looking?
There was something about Kerr black holes and gravity, right? Isn't that the cause?
What's a Kerr black hole? Is it different from a regular black hole?

Okabe: That's right... John Titor!
According to Titor, SERN finished their time machine in 2034. And then Titor himself came from 2036.

Kurisu: Creating Kerr black holes? That's insane. If you screw up, it could swallow the Earth... and besides, Kerr black holes are just a theoretical construct.



Kurisu: It wouldn't just gelify you. It would tear you apart particle from particle. That's what a black hole does.

Daru: Before we discuss this, shouldn't we look through the rest of their time machine research?
Here we go! There's a file in the Z Program that explains time travel theory.

Kurisu: That was pretty easy to find. SERN should have better security.

Daru: Their security's fine. I'm just too good.

Kurisu: I thought he was your super hacka.

Daru: Hacker!

Okabe: So what does it say, Christina?

Kurisu: Oh, right.
You know, this feels like one big joke.
Basically...

Daru: In Japanese please. Three lines max.

Kurisu: A small mass.

Daru: That explanation's too erotic!

Kurisu: Huh? What part of it is erot--
...
...Ah!
H-Hashida, you pervert!!

Daru: Sounds like you have a pretty good imagination yourself.

Kurisu: ugh.

Daru: Thrusting with great force.

Kurisu: Right. Successful compression generates a micro-singularity, which--

Daru: A micro singularity? Not a mini black hole?
Explain with cute girls.

Kurisu: Fine. Say there are two cute girls, Mic-chan and Cro-chan.

Daru: Sisters are moe. Haah, haah.

Kurisu: By feeding Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, you can make them do whatever you want.


Kurisu: 
So you force them to rotate at an extremely high velocity.


Kurisu: The resulting black hole exhibits what's called the Kerr effect.

Daru: What are Kerr black holes anyway? You said they spin, but what does that mean?

Kurisu: Exactly what it sounds like.

Daru: But don't black holes usually spin? I mean, there's a whirlpool around the hole, right?
...I'll pass on the guro.

Okabe: Before, you said that such a black hole's existence would be impossible to prove. What did you mean?

Kurisu: 
For example, if Okabe jumped into a black hole, time for him would stretch to infinity.
There is an exception, however. This exception is vital when you use a Kerr black hole for time travel.

Daru: Like I said, in Japanese please.

Kurisu: Didn't I already explain how the core spins? Just think of that as having momentum.
If you keep giving Mic-chan and Cro-chan electrons, they'll rotate faster and faster.


Daru: N-naked? You mean the magical girl costumes expose a lot of skin, right? When does the anime adaptation air?

Okabe: Naked, you mean it becomes observable.

Kurisu: When the event horizon disappears, there's no more reason for time and space to change places. Meaning that you can enter a naked singularity without being trapped.
The laws of physics are broken!
One thing I don't understand is how they inject electrons into the singularity.
Look. This is a picture of the LHC, but there's strange equipment installed at the proton collision site.

Daru: Lifter, lifter... I think I saw that in the Z Program files. Wanna google it?
We've got hits!

Kurisu: That many? I guess it's not a secret...
Ions are charged particles. The meaning matches.

Daru: It's floating...

Okabe: SERN is using this lifter technology. It's a vital component of their time machine.

Kurisu: But it looks like SERN's having trouble adjusting their lifter.
As a result, substances become fractalized. Let's go with that hypothesis. Of course, there's no way to be sure that it's right. It might take months to prove.

Okabe: So SERN's lifter is still incomplete...

Kurisu: We don't have half the equipment or funding SERN does. What makes you think you can solve a problem that they can't?
This isn't that simple.
There's no point traveling through time if you end up in tens of thousands of kilometers away from the Earth. It's not practical at all.
Titor's explanation on that point was vague.

Daru: But if you're only moving through time, won't you just arrive in the same location?

Kurisu: Of course not.

Daru: Why not?

Okabe: Because the Earth is always moving.

Kurisu: Right. Rotation and revolution.
The Earth's rotational velocity is about 1,650 kilometers per hour.
Its orbital velocity around the sun is about 114,000 kilometers per hour.
Meaning one hour ago, we were that far away from where we are now.

Daru: Whoa! When you think about it like that, we're earth-shatteringly fast!

Kurisu: And that's not all.
The Solar System is part of the Milky Way. And the Milky Way spins like a giant whirlpool.
There are various theories, but basically the earth moves about 50 million kilometers a day.

Daru: We've kinda gotten to a ludicrous scale.

Kurisu: By the way, the Milky Way is part of a large cluster of galaxies, which is itself part of an even larger supercluster.
And these clusters and superclusters might be moving too. If that's the case, we're moving even more than 50 million kilometers a day.
The point is that setting the destination would require insane calculations, even if you only want to travel one second into the past.
Doing it by hand is impossible, and it might take years for a supercomputer to come up with a solution, just to get you to the same location.

Okabe: Then we have no choice. We need to find Titor and borrow his variable gravity system.

Kurisu: Great idea. Go for it.
I wonder how SERN is dealing with this problem...

Okabe: 

Kurisu: Okabe.
Thanks.

Mayuri: Roundabout confluence?

Okabe: A meeting of lab mems.

Daru: Have we ever done that before?

Kurisu: Do you even have a round table?
Yes, you're mistaken. Don't go sticking things in people's hearts.

Mayuri: Is there one in Mayushii too?
Oh, that's good. But what's a roundable?

Daru: And why a round table? You King Arthur?

Kurisu: I'm only a temporary lab mem anyway.

Okabe: Anyway, it's a Round Table Conference! Mayuri wasn't here last night, so first, let's explain the situation to her.
Anyway, Ragnarok can no longer be averted. The final battle with SERN is near.

Mayuri: Why can't they be found?

Daru: Didn't you know, Mayu-shi? The world is constantly moving. Its rotational speed is 1500 kph, and its orbital speed is 114,000 kph--

Kurisu: SERN has been looking for solutions, but it's not going well.

Okabe: Now then. Have you learned anything that could help us complete the PhoneWave (name subject to change)?

Mayuri: It was made to warm Mayushii's chicken!

Kurisu: W-well, yeah.

Mayuri: It makes a black hole? Here?
It won't suck us in, will it?

Kurisu: But we still haven't figured out the electric discharge phenomenon, or the conditions required to cause it.

Mayuri: Chris-chan's right. It's too hard for Mayushii to remember.

Daru: It's way too chuuni, man.

Okabe: Fine! Then let's hear alternatives! Don't tell me you rejected my idea without having any bright ideas of your own!?

Kurisu: I think it needs to be something easy to understand. It's an email that regresses through time, so how about Retromail?

Mayuri: What does 'retro' mean?

Okabe: Sounds like you have your answer, Christina. You said it should be easy to understand, but it wasn't easy to understand at all, was it!?

Kurisu: B-but that's because Mayuri-san is...
Uh, n-never mind...

Okabe: Were you about to say 'because Mayuri's dumb'?

Kurisu: N-no!

Mayuri: Eh? Chris-chan, do you think Mayushii's dumb?

Kurisu: I don't! I promise I don't! Okay?

Daru: You're rejecting it for that?

Mayuri: Tutturu♪ Mayushii has an idea!
How about 'Back to the Mail'? I took a movie title, and changed a word to mail!

Daru: I already did the movie joke, Mayu-shi.

Kurisu: Besides, I think the meaning is a little off.

Okabe: Either way, it's too long!

Daru: Then how about DeLorean Mail?

Okabe: That doesn't even say what kind of email it is!

Kurisu: Hey. We don't have time for this nonsense. Let's just abbreviate it to 'D-Mail' and move on.

Okabe: But that's boring.

Kurisu: It don't care if it's boring.

Okabe: There is no think. Only do!
My plan... alright, there is one thing.

Daru: Well, I'm glad to see she has her priorities straight.

Mayuri: Mayushii's banana supply is getting low... gotta buy more.

Kurisu: Sorry, Mayuri-san. I'll go buy you some new bananas later.

Mayuri: Really? Yay♪
Okarin and Daru-kun eat my bananas, but they never buy new ones...

Kurisu: First, let's see if it'll become a jellyman.
Agh!
It was an accident!

Mayuri: Chris-chan, Chris-chan! Pain, pain, go away♪

Kurisu: Thanks, Mayuri-san.
Ah!

Daru: Whoa!

Kurisu: W-way to go, Okabe. It was so simple, I didn't notice it.
Anyway, let's see if we can send another D-Mail.

Okabe: Guh... I feel like my authority has been on the decline since that girl showed up.

Daru: It's cool, man. You never had any to begin with.

Kurisu: Help me, you two! Okabe, I'm sending an email to your phone.

Mayuri: What are you gonna send, Chris-chan?

Kurisu: You'll see. Ready? I'm sending it.

Daru: Starting the countdown!

Kurisu: Kya!
...Did it arrive?
Pfft...

Okabe: Christina. Did you send two mails?

Kurisu: Eh? No. I only sent one.

Mayuri: Mayushii saw it too. She really only sent one.

Kurisu: You're right... I even sent it in one sentence, but it got divided.
Why don't you look it up?

Okabe: Was it?

Daru: Yeah. Look at your history. I'm pretty sure I sent 'Okarin's a perv'.

Okabe: You're right. This one got split too.

Kurisu: I wonder what's causing it.

Mayuri: Um, Mayushii wants to know why it arrived five days ago.

Daru: Is there some kind of rule for when it arrives?

Mayuri: Let's try sending more!

Kurisu: He's at it again...

Okabe: Assistant, keep those mails coming! Try various patterns of text. Japanese, English, full-width, half-width, emoticons. The actual messages don't matter.

Mayuri: What about Mayushii?
Wow! You're so generous♪

Kurisu: So I guess your job is opening the microwave.

Daru: Whoa! You saved the easiest job for yourself?

Kurisu: Uh, I was just kidding.

Mayuri: Okarin, that's naughty!

Kurisu: Don't need one. Let's start.

Okabe: Wha... but...

Kurisu: Go ahead and rest. I'm gonna have a go at it a little longer.

Tennouji: Hey, Okabe. The hell are you doing up there?
Okabe!

Okabe: Christina! Stop the experiments at once!

Mayuri: Sorry, Okarin. Mayushii tried to warm up some chicken.
I accidentally put it through reverse rotation, and then it started sparking.

Kurisu: I sent you an email. Didn't you get it?

Okabe: Stop screwing around! I'm the one who has to deal with Mister Braun!

Kurisu: But I gave you five days advance notice.

Daru: Was he mad?

Okabe: Yeah... I could feel his Killing Aura.
Anyway, no more experiments today.

Kurisu: Well, at least we got some good data.
I'm dead tired, and my hair's dried out. I want to take a shower and go sleep.

Mayuri: If you want a shower, there's one here. It doesn't have a bath, though. Okarin always uses it.

Kurisu: It's probably filthy...

Okabe: I'd be lying if I called it clean. This entire building is in shambles.

Kurisu: Anyway, I refuse to use the same shower as Okabe.

Okabe: I understand. Nobody will blame you if you don't use it. Of course, since the three of us stayed up all night, we're all pretty smelly. Heh heh heh.

Kurisu: That's why I'm going back to my hotel once I finish eating.

Okabe: Celebrity bath time at a high class hotel? I want to come too.

Kurisu: Not a chance.

Mayuri: Mayushii wants to come too!

Kurisu: You can come any time, Mayuri-san.

Mayuri: Really? Thank you♪
Hey, Okarin, I've been wondering, but why do you drink soda while you eat? Does it make it taste better?

Daru: Me neither.

Kurisu: Same. I didn't give it a second thought.

Daru: It's normal, duh.

Okabe: Now, let's discuss Operation Urd's progress.

Daru: Operation Urd?

Kurisu: The experiments have been fruitful.
That about sums it up. Anything to add?

Mayuri: Um...

Daru: So much gel...

Mayuri: And you can send 36 letters in a D-Mail, but everything past that disappears, right-?
So I think maybe you can't send big things, or a lot of small things.
Maybe the Curb black hole--

Kurisu: Uh, it's Kerr black hole.

Mayuri: The Curb black hole--

Kurisu: Kerr black hole.

Mayuri: The hole is too tight!

Daru: Outrageous!

Okabe: Stop making her say stuff like that!

Kurisu: The hole is tight... huh. That might not be entirely wrong.

Daru: Anyway, 6 Japanese or 12 English characters comes out to 12 bytes.

Kurisu: Bytes? Not kilobytes?

Daru: Oh? So Makise-shi's bad with computers?

Kurisu: Sh-shut up! You don't see things measured in bytes nowadays, so I was just making sure...

Daru: Well, email isn't just comprised of text. There's more to it, like the sender and receiver's email addresses, the header, and various other things.

Kurisu: So larger masses get crushed by supergravity?
In any case, since the singularity isn't naked, the object is forced to pass through the event horizon.
But even a small mass has to pass through supergravity. How does it emerge unscathed?
I don't think it's that simple. I mean, I'm sure SERN's tried that already. And yet they haven't gotten any results after nine years of experiments.
SERN has a lifter, but we don't know what in the PhoneWave is filling the same role, much less how to adjust it.

Mayuri: I don't get it...

Kurisu: D-demon Lord...?

Okabe: But there's an exception.

Daru: Combining soldiers? That's just silly.

Mayuri: I get it! That's really easy to understand.

Kurisu: It is?

Daru: It's a dumb metaphor, but I guess it works? At least as an explanation for why things get gelified.

Mayuri: Mayushii was helpful?
Ehehe! Yay!

Kurisu: But it's still a hypothesis. It hasn't been proven.

Daru: How would you prove it? With human experiments like SERN?

Kurisu: If Okabe and Hashida-san volunteer as test subjects, I'll happily experiment on you.

Daru: Human experimentation sounds kinda dirty. If you know what I mean.
But I refuse. I'd rather play the doctor than the subject.

Kurisu: Idiots.
As I keep saying, the real problem is what the PhoneWave uses as a lifter.


Mayuri: Sending mail to the past is amazing, isn't it?

Kurisu: Even SERN has failed to send humans through. If you believe what Titor says, it won't be another, what, 24 years before there's a true time machine?
We should investigate the PhoneWave further. We need to understand what's going on.

Mayuri: You have to take off your shoes. It's dirty!

Daru: It's not the first. SERN beat us.

Kurisu: And you can't even say we developed it. It happened by accident.


Kurisu: I guess...

Mayuri: But Chris-chan, you said before that time machines don't exist, right? But now you admit they do!


Daru: Wait, that was a Round Table Conference? I didn't know that. And it's even the 66th.

Kurisu: Who cares what kind of table it is?

Moeka: Is it really a time machine?

Okabe: Yes. You'll see. But you can't tell anyone. Okay?

Daru: Alright, program complete.

Kurisu: Then lets resume the experiments.

Okabe: Heh, don't worry. Yesterday, I made this promise with Mister Braun. 'I swear there won't be any more shaking today.'
In other words, the no-shaking promise only applied yesterday, so since today is yesterday's tomorrow, we can shake it all we want!

Kurisu: That doesn't settle anything. Why you're so confident is a mystery to me.


Kurisu: No!
Besides, I don't think a wimp like you stands a chance against him.

Suzuha: Can't you tell? I'm polishing my bicycle!

Okabe: Aren't you working today?

Suzuha: Of course I am. Why else would I be here?

Kurisu: What, is she still tinkering with that bike of hers?
She was there when I came in, glaring at me.

Okabe: Hey, Part-Time Warrior! Where's Mister Braun?

Suzuha: Mister Braun? Who's that?

Okabe: The manager of that junk shop you work at.

Kurisu: It's not a junk shop. It's a CRT specialty shop.

Daru: Whatever. I want to try out the PhoneWave 2nd Edition v1.03.

Mayuri: Second attention verse erosion?

Daru: 2nd Edition v1.03.

Kurisu: The name doesn't matter. Let's just start the experi--

Moeka: You looked like you were having fun.

Kurisu: Hardly. I'm fed up with these people and their fooling around.


Kurisu: Who are you calling a tsundere!?

Daru: Oh? Makise-shi, you know what tsundere means?

Kurisu: N-no.
Mmmgh...

Okabe: What do you think? This proves that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) is an honest-to-goodness time machine.

Suzuha: It's shaking again! And there's a strange light, too! What are you doing up there!?

Okabe: Now then, lab mems.

Kurisu: Yesterday was the 66th. Where'd the other six go?

Okabe: Only anal retentive bastards care about the minor details. That's why you'll never be more than an assistant, Christina!
In the first stage of Operation Urd, we tested the limits of D-Mail technology.
Today, we advance to the second stage. Practical applications of D-Mail.
When I say practical applications, what I mean is...

Kurisu: Now hold on! It's too dangerous! Are you trying to play god!?

Daru: Nah, he's all talk. It's fine to ignore him, Makise-shi.

Kurisu: R-really?

Mayuri: Don't worry! Okarin's actually a very nice person. You'll see!

Okabe: I don't remember asking for an appraisal, but I'll answer Christina's question.

Daru: Correct, Makise-shi!

Kurisu: YES.

Daru: Okarin just says the first thing that comes to mind. He's always like that.

Okabe: Don't analyze me, Daru! And you, assistant! Stop that fist pumping! You making fun of me!?
First of all, the purpose of this experiment is to verify whether or not we can actually change the past. So it doesn't matter how trivial the change is.
Of course.

Kurisu: 
And that makes it okay to change the past? You're going to believe that self-proclaimed time traveler's delusions?

Daru: I'm for it. If we win the lottery, I can buy all the computer parts I want and go to MayQueen for every meal of the day. We'd be stupid not to try it.

Mayuri: Money? Okarin... that makes Mayushii sad.
We should do something that will bring peace to the world!
Like what if we give everybody in the whole wide world an Upa cushion?

Okabe: Hmph. Peace, you say? Don't be ridiculous.
I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyo--

Kurisu: And here I thought you had ambition.

Okabe: Don't get me wrong.
This isn't about world peace and it isn't about ambition. It's about discovering whether or not we can change the past.
The easiest way to do that is to see if we can win the lottery, right?

Kurisu: But your primary goal is the money, isn't it?

Okabe: With that kind of money, I could say goodbye to this rickety old building! Muhahaha! I could get an office in Daibiru or UPX!

Kurisu: See? Just like I thought.

Okabe: I won't whitewash it. If we moved, we could experiment as much as we want without fear of Mister Braun. If we had money, we could build the Future Gadgets of our dreams.
And of course, we could buy a truckload of Mayuri's favorite bananas.

Mayuri: A t-truckload?

Kurisu: No, Mayuri-san! Don't let him tempt you!

Okabe: Shut it, Celeb Seventeen!

Kurisu: S-se...? Serendipity?

Okabe: Celeb. Seventeen.

Kurisu: What the hell is that supposed to mean!?

Okabe: You live in a hotel off of your parents' money. You could never understand the plight of poor students like us.

Kurisu: 
What do you think, Moeka-san?

Moeka: 

Kurisu: Um...?

Okabe: If you're going to complain, then suggest an alternative. A change to the past that would be both trivial and easy to understand. Got anything?

Kurisu: One more word out of you and I excise your frontal lobe with a rusty scalpel.

Okabe: Even with a time machine before you all, this is all you can think of. You guys sure lack imagination.
It's me. We're beginning stage two of Operation Urd.
Now, begin the operation!

Daru: Uh, what do you want us to do?

Mayuri: First, we need to buy a lottery ticket.

Kurisu: No, first we need a winning number.

Okabe: Exactly, Celeb Seventeen! Now you're talking.

Kurisu: Don't call me Celeb Seventeen.

Mayuri: I saw a TV commercial for that the other day!

Okabe: Did they announce the winners?

Daru: Should be next week or the week after.
Oh, right.
We could wait until the Summer Jumbo drawing date.
Hmmm, I'll google it.

Kurisu: If someone sent me the winning numbers from the future, would I believe it?

Mayuri: Um, Mayushii doesn't even know how to buy a lottery ticket...

Kurisu: That's okay. I don't think teenage girls buy lottery tickets.

Mayuri: How about you, Okarin?

Okabe: I tried the LOTO SIX once.
W-wait! 1st prize is too much!
Anyway, we should aim a little lower. Daru, how much is 2nd prize?

Moeka: Eh...?
...

Kurisu: Thursday last week... so about five days. Is that okay?

Daru: The drawing was five days ago. It needs to arrive before that, right?

Kurisu: We'll send it to one week ago. 7 days is 168 hours, so let's round up a bit and enter 170#.

Moeka: I'll redo it.

Mayuri: Don't worry! Okarin loves shady things, so it's perfect!

Okabe: The time has come. Prepare to open Steins Gate!

Kurisu: It's been bugging me, but what is that Steins Gate thing?

Mayuri: It's Okarin's catch phrase♪

Kurisu: That doesn't explain anything.

Okabe: Th-that's right, the mail!
The mail arrived a week ago.

Mayuri: Hm? What's going on?

Okabe: Hey, Celeb Sev, did I win 3rd place?

Kurisu: Don't call me Celeb Sev! And 3rd place of what?

Okabe: what?
What did you say just now?

Kurisu: Wh-what?
Got a problem? I asked what, and then you just--
What?

Okabe: Mayuri, you were gonna buy a truckload of bananas... right?

Mayuri: A truckload? Who's gonna fill it up?

Okabe: Wait! What happened to stage two of Operation Urd!?

Kurisu: By stage two, you mean an experiment to see if we can change the past, right?

Mayuri: About what to send, so we can tell if the past has changed.

Daru: I think we should definitely go with Okarin's LOTO SIX idea.

Mayuri: Mayushii thinks we shouldn't be so greedy for dough.
Ah, but when I say dough, I don't mean like for baking.

Kurisu: I think we all know what you mean.

Okabe: Ah...!
Where did you get this!?

Luka: T-that hurts...

Mayuri: Don't pick on Luka-kun!

Kurisu: What's wrong with you, Okabe? You're acting weird.

Okabe: Sorry, Lukako, but I need to know. Where did you get that LOTO SIX ticket?

Daru: Wait, did Luka-shi win the LOTO SIX?

Kurisu: Don't tell me... you sent the winning numbers with the PhoneWave?
I did? What are you talking about?

Suzuha: That's how people talk when they've been brainwashed, Nae.

Nae: Eh?
Are you a liar, Mister Okarin?
...!

Suzuha: You shouldn't yell at children. Look, she's shaking.

Kurisu: You're even more of a perv than Okabe! I'm not using '-san' for you any more!

Okabe: Wait! We'll talk when everything's over.

Mayuri: Um, I'll buy more bananas tomorrow, okay?
So for now, hug this little guy suuuuper tight and cheer up, okay?

Okabe: Hey, assistant. You're not going back to your hotel?

Kurisu: What? You're kicking me out?
Do you need some advice? I'm an outsider, in a sense, so it should be easier to talk to me, right?
Of all your stupid names, that one's the worst.

Okabe: Want some coffee?

Kurisu: Sure.
What's wrong with you? Stop fidgeting.
That was a pretty heavy sigh.

Okabe: Christina. There's something I want to talk to you about.

Kurisu: Shouldn't you answer your phone first?

Okabe: It's Daru. It's probably something stupid.

Kurisu: You're really self-righteous, you know.
...
The past changed, so the present changed with it? The Butterfly Effect, huh. But what you're saying is nonsense.
Why do you remember that the past changed?

Aaaand he's at it again.
I'm not playing along with your games. I bet you came up with that Reading Whatever thing just now, didn't you?

Okabe: Hello?
Mistake?


Okabe: Wh...at?
...
Tch, persistent little...
Yeah? I'm not delivering your wallet, okay!?
Oh, it's you. You're with Daru, right? You don't have to lend that dumbass any money, okay?
No! I am a mad scientist full of madness and ambition!

...Hmph. I'm hanging up. Work hard now.
...Hmph, she thinks she knows me.

Kurisu: Okabe. You're grinning.
Don't call me Celeb Sev!

Okabe: 

Kurisu: You look like a girl in love waiting for an email from her boyfriend.

Okabe: Are you really that desperate for attention?

Kurisu: Just getting revenge. You're always making fun of me, so I deserve at least this much.

Okabe: Despite what you may think, I actually respect you.

Kurisu: That's rich. You don't even say my name right.
Well, that's unexpected... You actually apologized.

Who are you talking to?
Huh? No way.
No wonder you keep referencing Titor's posts. You believe him, don't you?
Really? I can't see it as anything but fiction.

Okabe: 
Muhahahahaha!

Kurisu: D-don't just start laughing like that. It's creepy.

Okabe: Hehehe, but I must! He says I have powers! Isn't that rich!?
You don't have to tell me what I already know, John Titor!
My true power... is the magic eye, 'Reading Steiner'!

Kurisu: Sounds to me like you've got a bad case of chuunibyou.

Okabe: Eh?

Kurisu: Eh...?

Okabe: 

Kurisu: 

Okabe: 
...Tch.
John Titor is a fraud!

I am no Messiah! I am the insane mad scientist, Hououin Kyouma, who has walked through fire and bathed in an ocean of blood to escape the clutches of the Organization!
My desire is chaos unending. Do you think that destroying the System will bring peace to the world? The answer is no! No, I say!
Death to the naive fools who believe such lies! The collapse of authority means that lawless CHAOS shall reign! MUHAHAHAHA!

Daru: Um, Makise-shi? What the hell happened to Okarin?

Kurisu: Beats me. A few hours ago, he was exchanging emails with John Titor, and then he suddenly got quiet.
And then he started ranting. He's been like this for half an hour.

Daru: He's been acting strange all day, don't you think?

Kurisu: Agreed.

Okabe: Listen up, lab mems! It's time to resume Operation Urd!

Daru: Seriously? The manager's still downstairs, you know?

Okabe: Fret not. It's almost closing time for the Braun Tube Workshop.

Kurisu: The PhoneWave doesn't work at night, remember?

Okabe: It's worth a try! We need to figure out how late the PhoneWave (name subject to change) works.
At the same time, I want to see if the two of you can use D-Mails to change the past.

Daru: Change the past...!

Kurisu: 

Okabe: Change the past to your liking. As long as it's something easy to observe.

Kurisu: I'm going back to my hotel. Show me your report on today's experiment tomorrow.

Okabe: Hold it!

Kurisu: Hey! What's your problem!?

Okabe: Who's writing that report?

Kurisu: You, of course. This is your operation.
And if we could get a report from the subject too, that would be even better.

Okabe: Are you not interested in changing the past? What happened to your eagerness to experiment?

Kurisu: Did you forget what I said this afternoon? I'm against it.

Okabe: But you were so enthusiastic when we began the experiments. You went along without a single complaint.

Kurisu: In your dreams, maybe.

Okabe: You're not being objective, Christi... Celeb Sev.

Kurisu: If you're going to correct yourself, at least get it right.

Daru: I remember every move Faris-tan made. It'll be easy to take her from behind. Aren't I a genius?

Okabe: Whatever. Daru, prepare to D-Mail!

Daru: Hell yeah! I'll give it my best shot!

Kurisu: So why do you think you're the only one who remembers?
Cut the jokes. I'm serious here.
Hmmm...
Changing the past feels like cheating.
That's not what I said...
I wouldn't.
S-something wrong with that?

Okabe: So basically, you like to experiment on other people while you watch and cackle at the results! You truly are a mad scientist!

Kurisu: Why you--

Daru: Done!

Kurisu: I don't get it.

Okabe: Why do I remember?

Daru: Did the past change?
Huh? Remember what?

Okabe: That you just sent a D-Mail!

Kurisu: Of course I remember. What are you...
Oh, I see. According to your hypothesis, you and I shouldn't remember sending the D-Mail.

Daru: I dunno.

Okabe: You said the winner gets Faris's home cooking, right? Did you eat it? What happened?

Daru: I don't know... This sucks.

Kurisu: Maybe the past hasn't changed?

Daru: I'll try calling Mayu-shi.
Mayu-shi? You're still at work, right? Is Faris-tan there? ...She is!?
Um, can you ask her if I beat her in the Faris Cup? Did I get to eat her home cooking?
...Who lost? I did? Oh... Barely took five seconds? Oh... okay...

Kurisu: I guess that means the past hasn't changed.

Daru: Why!? It changed for Okarin, right!?

Kurisu: Maybe your foolproof plan wasn't so foolproof. Like, maybe it only gave you a slight advantage.

Daru: Yeah, but I mean, the game would've played out differently.

Kurisu: Um, n-not that I approve of this experiment or anything.

Daru: No, it's not over yet. I can still fight!
One more time. I'll try sending my past self some more advice. This time, something that'll ensure my victory.

Kurisu: You really want to win that badly?

Okabe: 

Kurisu: Out of time?

Daru: But my advice was perfect...

Kurisu: After I left yesterday, I was thinking. How exactly does the PhoneWave make time travel possible?
If every microwave could turn into the LHC, then Japan would have black holes popping up everywhere.
I know it looks like SERN is able to create Kerr black holes willy-nilly, but that's not supposed to be possible.
It's ridiculous to suggest that a household microwave could generate a black hole.
Well, I'm going back to my hotel. I've had enough of this filthy man cave.
See you tomorrow. Don't forget to write that report.

Suzuha: Come on! You emailed him, didn't you?
What!? Why!? What went wrong!?

Okabe: Oh, so you're a Titor otaku.

Mayuri: Look, it's Chris-chan!
Chris-chan, tutturu♪

Kurisu: Good morning.
Nothing much. I told her if she wanted to say something, she should just say it.

Okabe: What did she say?

Kurisu: Nothing. She just groaned. I wonder what's wrong with her.

Daru: She's jealous of Makise-shi's popularity, duh!
She's thinking 'If only I'd joined the lab instead of her. Then I would be having fun with everyone right now! I'm so jealous!' or something like that.
I'm telling you, man. 3D is hell.

Kurisu: If she wants my lab mem number, she can have it.

Okabe: Mayuri, it's time for you to change the past.

Mayuri: Eh? Me? Are you sure?
But, um... what should I change?
Oh, I know! I'll make Luka-kun wear one of my costumes!
By sending Luka-kun a mail! Ehehe!
Hmm...

Okabe: Let's use that canned ramen.

Kurisu: I don't think that's enough to convince her to--

Mayuri: Oh, that might work!

Kurisu: Eh...?

Mayuri: When I went to the vending machine today, I spent ten minutes wondering if I should get canned oden or canned ramen. It was really hard!

Okabe: So a little push should be enough to make you choose canned oden! Alright, let's go with that!

Mayuri: Okay! But before we change the past, I gotta finish this ramen first.

Kurisu: What happens if you don't finish it?
Oh... of course. Ahaha...

Okabe: PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!

Mayuri: Aw... I haven't sent it yet...

Kurisu: So one second isn't enough for the discharge to occur. That's what I expected, but it's good to have proof.
Warming it up?

Okabe: Damn. Mayuri, got anything else!?

Mayuri: Um, well... we could change the flavor of rice ball I bought last night...

Okabe: Do you remember what kind of rice ball you ate last night?

Kurisu: She remembers!?

Daru: So, what sorta mail does Kiryu-shi plan to send?

Moeka: 

Okabe: A secret? What do you mean?

Kurisu: What's going on?

Moeka: 

Okabe: No, that's not the problem.

Kurisu: Hmmm, I see.
I understand how you feel, but since this is an experiment, data collection should take priority.


Mayuri: But girls have lots of secrets, you know?
You shouldn't ask her to tell her secrets, Okarin. That's perverted!

Daru: Whoa! Is that where we're going with this!?

Okabe: We're not asking you to send something private.

Kurisu: Even if you want to send something private, you shouldn't for now. We still don't know how this thing handles paradoxes, so we need to be extremely careful.
...I wasn't speaking for you. Don't misunderstand.
Experiments prioritize data over privacy in the first place. If you're going to be a test subject, you need to be prepared for that.

Mayuri: Really? Mayushii wasn't prepared for that...
I'm sorry, Chris-chan...

Kurisu: You don't have to apologize. I'm not criticizing you. It's just how these things work.

Moeka: 

Mayuri: Moeka-san is Moeka-san. Her fingers don't shine or anything...

Daru: Don't feed the trolls, Mayu-shi.

Kurisu: Cut the chatter and get started.

Daru: What if the manager says something?

Okabe: PhoneWave (name subject to change), activate!
Guh!!
Where's Shining Finger? Where'd she go?

Kurisu: Shining what?

Daru: Okarin. Japanese please.

Okabe: Where's Kiryu Moeka? She was here just now, wasn't she!?

Daru: Who's that?

Kurisu: Did it happen again, Okabe?
Oh yeah, Reading Steiner.

Mayuri: Are you okay? You're really pale.

Okabe: Assistant, how much do you remember about the experiment we just did?
Christina. Let's say a D-Mail caused a time paradox. What would happen?

Kurisu: I don't know. No one has experienced a time paradox, after all.
All I said was that that was one theory.
Maybe nothing happens, and like in a certain movie, history gets amended to accommodate the paradox.


Daru: That's Mayu-shi for you. A cute dumb girl.

Mayuri: Ehh? Mayushii's not dumb!

Okabe: !
...Ha, haha.

Kurisu: Explain what happened, Okabe.
Hmmm.
...Honestly, I'm not surprised she disappeared from the lab.

Daru: Is that even possible?

Kurisu: I don't know. If the fact that the D-Mail was sent is undone, then it becomes a paradox of who sent that D-Mail...
And there's one other thing that I don't understand.

Okabe: What?

Kurisu: By the way, you should quit it with that name. It's stupid.
By your explanation, you neither sent nor received the D-Mail. Yet how come you're the only one who remembers what happened before the worldline changed?
What if it's all in your head?

Daru: Like an imaginary girlfriend. I get it.

Kurisu: Maybe this Kiryu-san never existed. Or maybe Kiryu-san does exist, but the fact that she sent a D-Mail was something you made--
...eh?

Okabe: Ugh, ggh... my left eye, Reading Steiner, it aches!

Mayuri: Okarin, are you okay?

Daru: He's messing with us, right?

Kurisu: Y-yeah...

Okabe: I-I'm okay... This aching is normal... it'll end soon!

Mayuri: Okarin? Does it hurt?

Okabe: No... I'm okay now.

Kurisu: W-what? That was just an act, right?
Fine, I get it. You're a chuunibyou patient.

Daru: Eh?

Mayuri: Hm?

Kurisu: Ah...
Wh-why are you all staring at me? Don't look at me!

Okabe: Going home?

Kurisu: I think you're putting too much emphasis on appearances.
Y-you would?

Mayuri: And it's so close to work too♪ Hey, Chris-chan, why don't we all stay over some time?

Kurisu: Sure, if the guys aren't around.
Then why don't you come to my hotel, Mayuri-san?

Mayuri: Oh yeah, we did make that promise, huh? Ehehe! Then let's do that next time♪

Kurisu: You can come whenever you like. See you tomorrow.

Mayuri: Waaahh! Luka-kun finally wore one of my outfits!


Okabe: Ah, yeah, well...
Whew... Lukako. Foolish disciple of mine. From now on, you shall go into battle equipped with that costume and Samidare.
The Organization is making a move on Akiba.

Kurisu: Can you stop that vulgar laughter? I can hear you from outside. It's embarrassing.

Mayuri: Chris-chan, tutturu♪

Okabe: Mmgh!? You come here this late and dare insult me? And you call yourself my assistant!?

Kurisu: I'm not your assistant. Don't make me repeat myself.
Anyway! You're the worst, toying with such a weak and innocent girl. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

Daru: Toying with a weak and innocent girl, you say?

Kurisu: Don't react to every little thing, you perv.
At any rate...

Okabe: Christina. Stop eying Lukako's entire body from top to bottom like that.

Kurisu: I-I wasn't doing that!

Mayuri: Do you like the costume, Chris-chan? It really suits Luka-kun, dontcha think?

Kurisu: Is this that cosplay thing I've heard about? It's part of Japanimation culture, right?
You're very cute.

Luka: C-c-cute? No way...

Kurisu: Why are you crying? You look perfect, so you should be more confident.

Luka: Uuugh...

Okabe: Heh heh heh...

Luka: Eh...?

Kurisu: That's one hell of an acrobatic topic change.

Okabe: Listen, Lukako! Your desires can become reality. Japan is a land of great spiritual power. It resides in every word that slips from your tongue!

Luka: My... wish?

Kurisu: Well yeah, no wish is embarrassing compared to the idiotic wish for chaos to envelop the world or whatever.

Mayuri: Um, Mayushii's wish is to eat a ton of of yummy food, and to cover the lab with Upa goods, and to get Luka-kun to wear my costumes--


Daru: 'Shota in the Gate'!? That mistake is god tier. Probably because it's so... naughty.

Luka: I want... to be a girl.

Kurisu: What?
Wait. Wait a second.
Umm, what did she say?
I'm not your assistant, and I'm not Christina!
I have?
Is that some kind of joke?


Kurisu: Are you guys trolling me?

Daru: Eh?

Kurisu: Eh?
Is what Okabe says true?

Luka: I'm... a guy...

Kurisu: N-no way! Someone this cute can't be a boy!

Daru: You've got it backwards. You're supposed to say 'Someone this cute can't be a girl.'

Kurisu: That's not what I meant.

Daru: Why do you keep repeating that last part?

Okabe: Why, Christina. Is it such a shock to meet a man far more feminine than you?

Mayuri: Chris-chan's cute too♪

Kurisu: Don't try to comfort me. It just makes me feel worse.

Okabe: Admitting your faults is the first step towards becoming stronger. You may one day become a splendid woman, Christina. You're still young.

Kurisu: Who the hell asked you?
Shut up. I don't want to hear that from you.

Luka: Um... sorry. I shouldn't have said anything.

Daru: Welp, better get my trusty digicam...

Kurisu: Don't try to sneak in a photo session, you perv!

Okabe: Lukako, how serious are you about that wish of yours?

Luka: You know those stories where a guy magically turns into a girl overnight? Sometimes I wish that would happen to me.
Ahaha... that's stupid, isn't it?

Mayuri: Luka-kun, you're so cute♪

Kurisu: S-So cute...
This reminds me of something I heard once.

Daru: Exposition scene, go!


Kurisu: I saw it on the internet.

Daru: S-so that's how you reply... well played.

Kurisu: Wh-what are you talking about?

Mayuri: Really? I didn't know that. So Mayushii and Chris-chan's moms ate a lot of vegetables?
Mayushii only eats Juicy Chicken Number One, so will her future child be a boy?
Hey, do you think bananas count as vegetables?

Kurisu: I never said it was true.
I just remembered hearing it somewhere. Don't snap at every little thing.
...What are you implying?

Mayuri: PhoneWave-chan? It can tell if you'll have a boy or a girl?

Kurisu: Wait... of course.
Well...
Who are you calling an experiment-loving girl!?
N-no, but...

Mayuri: Really? You should've just said so!

Luka: I didn't have the courage... Like I said, I don't know a thing about gadgets...

Mayuri: You don't have to worry about those things. I mean, Mayuri doesn't get them either.

Kurisu: Here.
...*sigh*

Luka: Um... right.

Mayuri: Yup! The same year as Mayushii. What about it?

Okabe: When did cellphones become widespread in Japan!?

Kurisu: Ah...

Daru: Around 1996. There wasn't mail until later, though.

Mayuri: Oh! I get it!

Luka: Eh...? We can't do it?

Kurisu: What the hell are crazy waves?

Daru: Waves that only crazy girls can pick up. You know, girls who always talk about stuff no one understands. It's pretty moe.

Kurisu: I'll microwave your brain if you don't shut up.

Daru: Yes! Abuse me more, please!

Mayuri: Um, couldn't you put a letter in a time capsule and bury it?

Kurisu: That would go to the future, not the past.

Mayuri: Oh...

Daru: I know! How about that thing where you get struck by lightning and that turns you into a girl! Like in old comics and anime.

Kurisu: There's no point to the experiment if we don't use D-Mail. Don't lose sight of the objective.

Mayuri: We're counting on you for a nice idea, Chris-chan♪

Kurisu: M-me? I...
We could... build a rocket which exceeds the speed of light squared, then that immense speed would reverse the flow of time, or something...
It was just a joke. Don't take it seriously.
Fine then. Let's hear from Hououin Kyouma, the insane mad scientist with an IQ over 170 whose brain cells are coveted the world over. What's your genius plan?

Okabe: I have it.


Luka: H-hello...
Mom had a pager.

Mayuri: Yay! That's great, Luka-kun!

Kurisu: Urushibara-san, you need to think about what to send to your mother in the past.

Luka: How about something like this?
'MOM EAT VEGGIES OK'

Daru: Isn't that a little too vague?

Luka: Then... 'EAT LOTS OF VEGGIES TO GIVE BIRTH TO A GIRL'.

Kurisu: That's a little too direct. And it's over the character limit.

Luka: 'EAT VEGGIES FOR HEALTHY KID'

Daru: Wait a sec. According to this conversion chart, it looks like you gotta use two more numbers for voiced consonants.

Okabe: Then a little modification. How about 'EAT VEG 4 HEALTHY KID'?

Kurisu: Isn't that a little too informal? You're talking to Urushibara-san's mother, you know? Would she understand the 'VEG 4' part?

Okabe: Nn...

Luka: Um, Okabe-san, could you... please not look at me like that?

Okabe: It... didn't work?
Don't you remember? Just now, we used the PhoneWave (name subject to change) to--
Sorry. It's nothing.
Christina. I want to ask you something. Is Lukako...

Kurisu: What pervy act are you thinking about this time? Can't be too careful around the perv duo.

Daru: We're not a perv duo. We are a pervy gentlemen duo!

Kurisu: Whatever. Seriously, whatever.

Faris: Nyaa... looks like you guys have kicked reason to the curb, nya.
But Faris wants to use the time machine too, nya. Can I, please?

Daru: Sure! I'll let you use it as much as you want, Faris-tan.

Faris: Really nya? Then it's a promise, nya!

Kurisu: What? You called me all the way to Japan, and now you--
...I knew it. You never wanted to see me, did you?
...
I... I...
Ugh...
I wasn't crying, okay!?
Anyway, I wasn't crying. Understand? End of discussion. Sniff.

Okabe: 
Christina.

Kurisu: Eh?
Ah... yeah...

Okabe: Mayuri.

Mayuri: Hm?
Really? You never treat me.
Then how about Kitchen Jiro?
Their minced cutlet is, um, god tier.
Yay! I love you, Okarin♪ Mayushii's really happy!

Okabe: Thanks for coming in on a Saturday. Your devotion to science makes me proud.

Kurisu: Yeah...
Where did I go wrong?
I'm not crying!
Besides, you're the one who told us to be here.


Kurisu: Eh, wha...!?
How can this girl say something like that while eating a nugget...


Kurisu: Please unget it.
Don't put that there. It's filthy.

Okabe: I just washed them!

Kurisu: Like I care. What kind of guy puts his underwear in a girl's face? Have some decency.
Wh-wha...!

Okabe: As I explained to Daru yesterday, I've noticed something about the results of our experiments!

Kurisu: It's not like we can do anything about that. After all, the result is up to whoever receives the mail.
Though that might be a bit too much for Hououin Underwear here.

Daru: Another Round Table?

Kurisu: Don't be ridiculous.

Mayuri: You'll become a GelOkarin! Ehehe!


Kurisu: This isn't a laughing matter...

Daru: But we're not the first. Didn't SERN do it before us?

Okabe: Humanity's first time-traveling email. For we who have achieved that miracle, nothing is impossible!

Kurisu: It's futile.

Daru: I'll pass on leaping into deep space, thanks.

Okabe: Wait a second.


Kurisu: If you want to become GelOkarin, I'm not stopping you.

Okabe: 

Kurisu: It would be best to leave physical transfer aside for now. Sending data through time is an amazing feat by itself. We should be satisfied with what we've got.

Okabe: Such pessimism is unbecoming of a scientist sworn to uncover the secrets of the universe.

Kurisu: You watch too many movies.
Yeah, but...

Okabe: If we go public, we won't be able to do cool stuff with D-Mails anymore!


Daru: Eh?

Kurisu: Ah...
Shut up! I'm not, okay!?

Daru: Yeah, right now I'm combing SERN's massive database.

Mayuri: Hell☆

Okabe: Give me your report, Christina. If you don't, I'll call you an '@channeler'--

Kurisu: Didn't you hear me the first time!?
I've been working on the translation when I have time, but so far I haven't seen anything new about time travel.


Okabe: Hey, Christina. Are you doing that on purpose?

Kurisu: Ugh... d-doing what?

Daru: Anyway, I'm just doing it for laughs. It's not like we have any reason to use the LHC.

Okabe: You said all we needed was an IBN 5100 of our own!
Huh?
But I got you an IBN 5100. You haven't started working on it yet?

Daru: Huh? You got one? When?

Kurisu: First I've heard of it.

Okabe: Impossible!
...It's gone.
The IBN 5100 was right here! Where did it go!?

Daru: Donated to Yanabayashi Shrine? That's stupid.

Kurisu: You sure you weren't hallucinating? It's hot these days.

Okabe: Don't tell me it was John Titor!?
Of course! Titor's goal was to obtain an IBN 5100! And I've already contacted him several times. But how did he get my personal information!?

Kurisu: Calm down.
Tell us what happened. You don't have to be precise. Just say whatever comes to mind. We can work it out later.
Hmmm...
But from my perspective, all of the D-Mails we sent so far were trivial.

Mayuri: Um, there's that one we sent when we first realized PhoneWave-chan was a time machine, right?

Daru: The one that said 'Okarin is a perv'.

Kurisu: And during the preliminary D-Mail experiments, I sent dozens to Okabe's phone. But they were all insubstantial, so I don't think they could've changed the past.

Daru: I sent two of them when I was trying to win the match against Faris.

Kurisu: There was one more. The first mail Okabe accidentally sent that said I was dead.

Okabe: But from my perspective, we sent several more.

Mayuri: You mean how you sent the winning LOTO SIX numbers? And how Luka-chan bought a ticket with those numbers, but didn't win?

Kurisu: But nobody aside from Okabe remembers him sending it.

Daru: We were so close.

Mayuri: Is that all?

Okabe: No. There's more. Moeka and Lukako each sent a D-Mail.

Kurisu: Oh, right. That's what you claim, but Hashida, Mayuri-san, and I don't remember either of those.

Mayuri: Owww... Mayushii's getting a headache...

Okabe: I already told you guys. I'm the only one who keeps his memories after the world changes.

Kurisu: So according to your perspective, when did the IBN 5100 disappear? Did it just happen? When's the last time you remember seeing it in the lab?

Okabe: Well...
I'm sure... it was August 3rd. I remember it being in the lab on August 3rd.

Kurisu: Are you certain?

Okabe: I saw something?
More importantly, I have questions about the IBN 5100.
IBN 5100. About nine years ago, someone dedicated a retro PC to Yanabayashi Shrine. That's the one. Know anything?
Just a while ago, I came to the shrine looking for it, didn't I!? And then I asked your old man and he let me borrow it. Right!?
...Right?
The IBN 5100 was at the shrine though, right? Is it there now?
Where are you now? Is your old man there?
...Damn. Okay. Sorry for calling you so suddenly.
Mayuri, I need to contact Faris.

Mayuri: Hweh?
Want one, Okarin? They're delicious♪

Okabe: You people don't have a care in the world, do you!? There's some crazy stuff happening here!

Kurisu: Or it could all just be in your head. No need to panic.

Mayuri: You need Feris-chan for something? I wonder if she's working today.

Okabe: You know her phone number, right? See if you can get ahold of her.

Mayuri: Okay!
Feris-chan? Good afternyan-nyan♪ It's Mayushii, nyan♪

Kurisu: Nya, nyan...?

Mayuri: Umm, so does that mean it has to keep going for 86,000 seconds?
Won't PhoneWave-chan get tired?

Okabe: It's me. What's the situation?
She hung up on me!

Daru: Of course she did. Mayu-shi and I are the only ones who can deal with your act, you know?


Okabe: It's Hououin Kyouma. Don't hang up.
It shows you my number, doesn't it!?
In other words, you fear the insanity of Hououin Kyouma! Well, I suppose you can't be blamed for--
She hung up! Again!

Daru: Like I said, we're the only ones who can put up with you...


Okabe: This is Okabe Rintaro. Sorry, but could you mess with the PhoneWave (name subject to change)'s settings a little, please?
We're about to perform a critical experiment. Understand, assistant? Mister Braun might yell at you, but that small sacrifice will bring mankind's dream, the time machine, to fruition.


Luka: Pardon the intrusion, Okabe-san.

Mayuri: Good morning, Okarin♪
Yesterday I went to Nakano to buy doujinshi, remember? While I was there, I found a photo album of a super cute cosplayer!

I know! Once ComiMa's over, let's all go on a trip to the beach! Mayushii's been making costumes all summer. I haven't had time to play at all.
What do you think, guys? A lab mem beach trip!

Luka: Um... all of the lab mems?

Kurisu: I can't go. I have to go back to America soon, and I haven't even started packing yet.

Okabe: Yes, I can see you're in a rush. I bet you don't even have time to lounge around and read.

Kurisu: 
Fine, I'll be blunt. There's no way I'm swimming with two perverts like you!
If it's just the girl members, I'll happily go.


Kurisu: I don't have a Mongolian Spot!
What's that supposed to mean?
You're the worst. Where do you get off calling her a guy?

Mayuri: Yeah, Okarin. That's a terrible thing to say.

Kurisu: Okabe!
If you want to give me stupid nicknames, that's fine -- I mean, it's not, but...
I didn't take you for the the kind of guy who thinks it's funny to hurt people's feelings, but I guess I was wrong. You're a real jerk, Okabe.
Apologize. Apologize to Urushibara-san right now.

Luka: So that's how Okabe-san sees me...

Kurisu: You're the one denying reality!

Mayuri: That's right! Luka-chan's a girl, Okarin. You're terrible.

Okabe: Hold it, Lukako! You can't fool me! You're as much a man as I am! And I know how to prove it!
Oh...?
Ohhhh? Huh? What? Why?
Lukako, you...

Kurisu: That's what we've been saying!

Luka: hic... ugg... egh...

Kurisu: I want to vivisect your skull and remove your brain for a good washing.
Then I'll submerge it in culture fluid so you can never do anything like that again!
Anyway, just be thankful I haven't reported you to the police.
Anyway, what in the hell made you think that Urushibara-san was a boy?
Want some more?

Okabe: I'm telling the truth. You have to believe me!

Kurisu: Sit down before I hit you again.


Mayuri: Shredding Gar?

Daru: Schrodinger's cat again?

Kurisu: You're Japanese too.


Okabe: Anyway, my magic eye has the power to perceive changes in the worldline. This power is called Reading Steiner, as I've explained.

Kurisu: And I told you that that name was stupid, remember?
Not to mention it's a grammatical mess, and there's also the fact that it's half German, so no consistency there either. It's stupid.
Show a little remorse, huh?

Okabe: So I can use your grief to power my time machine. Heh heh heh!

Suzuha: Ahaha! You really are a mad scientist. So eeeevil!

Okabe: Hey, wait! Let me on! Hey!

I want you guys to get ready for a party.

Kurisu: And what are you going to do?

Okabe: Me? I'm going to follow that Part-Time Warrior and report back as the situation changes.

Kurisu: Don't you dare. Let her be alone with her father.

Okabe: Heh heh heh. You shouldn't be so quick to reject my plans, Christina. You don't understand the intricacies of the human psyche.


Kurisu: Get over yourself.

Okabe: Besides, Christina, you and she are enemies, are you not? You protect her from me while plotting her demise? That makes you a hypocrite!

Kurisu: You just don't have standards, that's all.

Mayuri: She's right. I don't think you should bother her, Okarin.
No matter what happens, we need to give her a waaaarm welcome. I'll do anything to help make this party super special.

Luka: Um, actually, I haven't met this Suzuha-san...

Mayuri: Suzu-san's really nice. I'm sure you'll get along with her too!

Kurisu: Nice?

Okabe: Anyway, I'm going to tail her now. You guys--

Kurisu: No! Get it through your thick skull!

Okabe: Dammit, assistant! How dare you give me orders!?

Kurisu: Don't even think about running off somewhere.
Anyway...
I hope Amane-san finds her father.

Okabe: Yeah.

Kurisu: That would be... nice.
Hey, Okabe...
I'm sorry about before.

Okabe: Before?

Kurisu: When I hit you with my book. I thought you were just being a pervert.
But when I thought about it later, I realized that you were being completely serious.
But I acted on impulse, without even considering what you had to say.

Okabe: Forget it. Regardless of my intentions, the fact of the matter is that I made Lukako cry.

Kurisu: Just to make sure, you're not a perverted scumbag, are you?

Okabe: Make sure, my ass! Are you trying to apologize or what!?

Kurisu: I just don't want to you to use science as an excuse to be a pervert. Not while I'm helping, at least.

Okabe: What do you take me for?
My friends are precious to me.
I may be an insane mad scientist with an IQ of 170, but even I have my limits.
The PhoneWave (name subject to change) wouldn't have come this far without you and Daru at my side.

Kurisu: Okabe...

Okabe: I am Lab Mem 001, the founder of the lab.
If my friends are in danger, I'll rush to their aid. And I would tear my own limbs off before I knowingly brought harm to any of you.

Kurisu: Pff...

Okabe: What's so funny?

Kurisu: That has to be the cheesiest thing you've ever said.

Okabe: Hmph...

Kurisu: Still, it's nice to hear.
The research institute I work at in America is full of talented people from all over the world... but it's not a friendly place.

When my thesis was chosen to represent the lab, many of the older men complained.
And when I came back here as a kind of reverse exchange student, my classmates were all too afraid to talk to me.
Compared to that, your lab is childish... but comfortable.
You're really concerned about Amane-san, aren't you? That part of you, I can respect.
B-but I'm not praising you, okay?
I just... you know... thought you should know...

Okabe: Maybe I...

Kurisu: Eh?

Okabe: Maybe all I ever wanted was friends.

Kurisu: Okabe...

Okabe: There aren't many people I can trust...

Kurisu: I, um... think of you as a friend too.

Okabe: What?

Kurisu: You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you.
That made me really... happy, I guess.

Okabe: Do you have a fever?

Kurisu: No!
What the hell!? Here I am trying to find something decent about you, and you... I don't care anymore, stupid!
You're really... stupid.
Huh? Over there, isn't that...

Daru: Dammit! Why do they have to be on the same day!? Can't it wait until tomorrow?
I want to eat Faris-tan's home cooking...
I give up. I give up the offline meeeet!

Mayuri: Huh? Daru-kun's here too?

Daru: What about Faris-tan? Where is she?

Kurisu: You've been tricked.

Mayuri: Feris-chan said she couldn't come.

Daru: Wait, seriously!? Okarin! What's going on here!? This isn't funny, man!
You've gotta be kidding me! I was looking forward to that time machine meet...

Kurisu: Time machine meet? What's that?

Daru: Some famous writers are going to be there. I won't forgive you, Okarin. Ever.

Okabe: What? Why didn't you say so? I would've gone too!

Kurisu: Smell what?

Luka: S-sorry...

Kurisu: I'll help too.

Suzuha: You're a nice guy. You know that?
I think talking to you really did help.

Okabe: !?

Mayuri: Okarin! Did you find Suzu-san?

Kurisu: Tell us what happened.

Mayuri: Oh...

Okabe: MUHAHAHAHA!

Luka: O-Okabe-san? What's wrong? Are you okay?

Kurisu: His brain is probably oxygen-starved from too much running.

Daru: Okarin... chill.

Okabe: Why the long faces, friends!?

Kurisu: You're going to send a D-Mail?

Daru: And the transfer rate is hundreds of times better than usual. Crazy fast! You can't even get these numbers domestically, man.
But thanks to this direct line, we can now control the LHC remotely.

Mayuri: Wow! That's amazing, Daru-kun.
The LHC is that 20-kilometer-long tunnel thing, right? Um, what does it do again?
Oh yeah. Mini black holes, right?

Okabe: What's wrong?

Kurisu: I figured it out.

Okabe: Give me details.


Kurisu: But there's still one thing I don't understand.
Even if it does produce mini black holes, they should evaporate instantly.
But that's not what happens in the PhoneWave. The gelification phenomenon proves that.
Just like in the LHC, our mini black holes are turning into Kerr black holes.

Okabe: According to Titor, you have to inject electrons to produce the Kerr black hole effect.

Kurisu: Where do the injected electrons come from? That's what I don't understand.
The LHC uses something called a lifter to inject electrons into the black hole and control the gravitational field.
Something is filling that role inside the PhoneWave.

Daru: S-something?

Kurisu: Like I said, I don't know what.

Daru: LHC stands for Large Hadron Collider.

Okabe: And that, my fellow lab members, brings us to the question. Can the PhoneWave (name subject to change) beat SERN to true physical time travel?

Daru: Convert a human to data? That's not even possible, man.

Kurisu: Of course... If it works, then maybe...

Okabe: Are you serious?

Kurisu: The data compression part, at least, is easy.
The title of my thesis is...


Kurisu: I'm a neuroscientist. Got a problem?
Converting an entire human to data is impossible.
Imagine a chest of drawers. Each drawer is filled with tiny boxes, and inside each box is another bunch of tiny boxes. You keep opening boxes until you find the memory you're looking for.
Put simply, it enables conversion of video data into nerve impulse signals.

Okabe: So basically, what you're saying is that we convert the subject's memories into video data...

Kurisu: The important thing to remember is that only memories are being transferred.
Time leaping in sci-fi usually sends everything -- consciousness, personality, and memory.

Daru: But videos can take up way more space than the OS.

Kurisu: Your memories aren't the only thing that define you. Even if you send your memories to the past, it will be the receiving you's consciousness and personality that process them.

Daru: 
Wouldn't want to jump into someone else's body. I mean, unless it's the body of a cute girl. Uhehe!

Kurisu: Don't 'uhehe' me, you idiot!
There are two things I do know. One, you definitely cannot go back before you were born; and two, you won't exist in two places at once.

Okabe: 
Were you listening? Good. Commence preparations for Operation Verthandi!

Kurisu: First, explain what that is!

Okabe: What are you doing?
You're thinking too hard. Finish the machine, then worry about it.

Kurisu: You're so pompous.
...
Hey, Okabe...

Okabe: Very well. Speak!

Kurisu: Heh... you really are pompous.
...Yeah.
And then I started winning those arguments. All of them.
You really think that's why?
I guess he did have a lot of pride.

Okabe: He's in Japan, right? Have you seen him at all?

Kurisu: I'm not acting like a little girl!

Okabe: It's the only way to get your message across. You can't sugarcoat it.

Kurisu: I... guess you're right.

Okabe: Well? When are you going to see him?

Kurisu: Huh?

Okabe: I assume it'll be during summer break. Make sure you let me know ahead of time.

Kurisu: 
...pfft!
But... thanks anyway. I definitely didn't expect you to offer to come...
N-not that I'm happy about it or anything!
Um, Okabe? That offer... I can take you up on it, right?
I want you to come with me.
What? You're not going to back out, are you? You already promised. I'm taking you whether you like it or not, okay!?

Okabe: I can't be sure. There are still several problems remaining. If they don't give us too much trouble, I guess we'll have it done in a week.

Moeka: Hehehe...

Mayuri: What do you think is wrong with Moeka-san?
Whaaah? Now Okarin's acting weird!

Kurisu: Ah...
H-hey! Think you could knock!?

Okabe: This isn't your room. Besides, I'd have to be a fool to knock. There could be assassins lying in ambush.

Kurisu: Assassins? Here? Are you stupid?

Okabe: Anyway, Christina. What were you looking at just now, hmm?

Kurisu: I was... doing research!
S-stay back!

Okabe: 

Kurisu: 
G-got a problem?

Okabe: pfft!

Kurisu: Hey! What's with that 'this is awful, rofl rofl' laughter!?

Okabe: Have no fear, Christina. Or should I call you... @channeler Chris!

Kurisu: Don't call me that!

Okabe: Heh heh heh, I already knew. That's right! I realized long ago that you were an @channeler!
You can't hide it from me. You reek of @channel corruption!

Kurisu: How rude! I make sure to apply light perfume every day!

Okabe: Fool. That's not what I meant. I'm talking about the scent of your soul.

Kurisu: My soul? What's that supposed to mean? Explain.

Okabe: Why? So you can learn how to hide it?

Kurisu: Sh-shut up! Just explain already.

Okabe: There's nothing to explain. You use @channel memes in conversation. I'd have to be stupid not to notice.

Kurisu: Feels bad, man.

Okabe: That's an @channel meme too.

Kurisu: Ugh...

Okabe: Your soul is tainted with the essence of @channel. You cannot hide it, not in such close proximity to another who uses @channel memes in actual conversation. Your souls resonate.

Kurisu: That's it! It's all Hashida's fault!

Okabe: But it's cute how you try to hide it, @channeler Chris.

Kurisu: DON'T CALL ME THAT.

Okabe: But I don't understand. You were raised in America, so how are you so familiar with @channel?

Kurisu: You can browse @channel from America. Need I say more?
Anyway, can I ask a favor?
Not a chance, you idiot!


Kurisu: Gh, I hate myself for understanding those words!
You don't have to worry about me. Remember that I represented my entire laboratory when we presented our research, even though there were men twice my age on the project.


Kurisu: Gah!
No...!

Okabe: Are you staying to work on your costume?

Mayuri: It won't be done in time for ComiMa if I don't. Ehehe!

Okabe: I'm surprised your parents let you stay.
It must be my overwhelming charisma... No, wait, that makes me sound like a good person, so that can't be it...
Of course! Mayuri's parents are so afraid of my insanity that they sent me their only daughter as a hostage!

Kurisu: Reported.
What would you do if I called the cops on you?

Okabe: I unleash my right arm on traitors, Christina.

Kurisu: Yeah, yeah, chuunibyou, whatever.

Mayuri: Um, I told Mom and Dad that Chris-chan would be here. Then they said okay.

Kurisu: Wait, so I have to stay too?

Mayuri: Yup♪ Don't you have to work on the PhoneWave?

Kurisu: I guess... but I don't relish the thought of spending the night here. At least, not with a certain somebody around.

Okabe: Environment matters, Christina. This is a place of science and research, so you should have no trouble concentrating on your work. Trust the great Hououin Kyouma.
Also, it may surprise you to learn that I have equipped this lab with a system that stimulates brain function.
So if you were wondering where my incredible genius comes from, now you know! It's because I sleep in this room every night!

Kurisu: This stimulation system of yours... I assume it's been dumping toxic waste in your brain?

Okabe: You sound like an environmentalist, Zombie.

Mayuri: Ah, Mayushii knows! You're talking about that, right?

Kurisu: This... air freshener?

Mayuri: Okarin said the smell makes you smarter. He bought it at Akiba-o. When was that?

Okabe: About six months ago. It was on sale for 500 yen.

Kurisu: I'm starting to think even you don't believe the stuff you say.
And besides, this air freshener is empty.
Well, whatever. I was planning to stay either way. I'll join you, Mayuri-san.

Mayuri: Really? That's great!

Kurisu: On one condition. Okabe leaves.

Okabe: Me, leave? I practically live here! This lab was promised to me by Steins Gate. It's the dwelling place of my soul!

Kurisu: We girls are staying here overnight, so you filthy boys need to show respect. Your home isn't even far from here, right?

Mayuri: Okarin lives close to Mayushii, in Ikebukuro.

Kurisu: Why, that's less than 30 minutes by train. Anyway, I'm not going to need your help tonight, so just go home like a good boy, okay?

Okabe: But I refuse.

Kurisu: What? Are you planning to molest us!?
I don't have a Mongolian Spot! And when did you see my butt, anyway!?

Mayuri: But Okarin's a minor too!

Kurisu: I'm pretty sure that makes you a minor just like us.

Mayuri: Um, Chris-chan? I don't think Okarin would do anything bad.

Kurisu: But he took you hostage, didn't he?

Mayuri: Yup♪ Actually, I'm still his hostage.

Kurisu: We should kick him out of the room.

Okabe: This lab is a place of science. We are above such petty concerns as sex. If you must speak of these vulgarities, then I'll have to ask you and your Mongolian Spot to leave!
Ah. So Christina really does have a birthmark on her bu--

Kurisu: NO!

Okabe: Is everyone okay!?

Kurisu: Kyaaa! What are you doing!?

Okabe: Phew. You're still alive.

Kurisu: Get out, you perv!

Mayuri: Mayushii's sad... I feel kinda dirty....

Okabe: It's me. We have a problem. I'm under attack from the Mongolian Spot and Ditzy sisters. They're going directly after my sanity, a bold move against the insane mad scientist Hououin Kyouma.

Kurisu: For the final adjustments, we need to use the PhoneWave.

Daru: It's up to you, Okarin.

Okabe: In other words, you're sending me to die.

Kurisu: I can't. That girl who works there hates me.

Tennouji: What are the hell are you laughing about, Okabe? You're scaring my daughter! I'm raising your rent, you hear!? And you're paying for that CRT!

Okabe: Guh!
All's well that ends well! Muhahaha!

Mayuri: Okarin! The building just shook. Are you okay?

Kurisu: How could you miss something so obvious?
...I'm not blaming you. I'm just disappointed that nobody, including myself, noticed.

Daru: We missed the forest for the trees.

Kurisu: The discharge was interrupted.

Mayuri: I'm glad. We shouldn't waste food.

Kurisu: We've found the answer.

Daru: So the reason we can't use the PhoneWave at night is because the Braun Tube Workshop's closed?

Kurisu: It's not about having a strong electron stream. If stronger were better, SERN would've solved the lifter problem long ago.
Somehow, the conditions here were perfect to create a time machine. Frankly, it's a miracle.
Whatever it is, it worked.

Mayuri: Umm...
So, um, what do we have to do to complete Super PhoneWave-chan?

Kurisu: Now that we've found the cause, there's nothing left to hold us back.

Daru: We should probably test it, right? And there's still the final check of the PhoneWave to do.

Kurisu: You're right. Okabe.

Okabe: Mission: Impossible!

Kurisu: Whatever. Just go already.
No.

Daru: Damn. That was harsh.

Kurisu: Oh, whoops. I was supposed to flatter him so he'd feel like going, right?
Yes, you're an amazing mad scientist.
Anyway, now that we've found the lifter, the time leap machine is 99% complete.
Okabe.

Mayuri: Fwapp!

Daru: I got a fwapp!

Mayuri: Okay. Thanks!
Yup. I finished before Chris-chan. We were racing.

Kurisu: Done.

Mayuri: It's a tie...

Kurisu: We may have created a monster here...

Okabe: Why don't we decide what to call it first?
I vote Heavenly Express!

Daru: PhoneWave 3rd Edition ver1.00.

Mayuri: Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan.

Kurisu: You guys have too much free time.
...Time Leap Machine.

Daru: That's terrible.

Kurisu: C-come on! Simple is best, right? I mean, that's what Okabe's been calling it for the past two days.

Daru: Oh-ho! So Makise-shi knows the word chuunibyou... I sense your otaku level is quite high.

Kurisu: I... heard it from a friend. I have no idea where it comes from!

Mayuri: Hmmm...
I think Time Leap Machine is fine.
Silly Hat PhoneWave-chan is super close though...
Ehehe!

Kurisu: In short, this device converts memories to data and sends them to the past.
The PhoneWave now has headgear attached.

Then, using VR technology, we encode the nerve impulses into electrical signal data.

Daru: It comes out to approximately 3.24 terabytes.

Kurisu: By the way, we'll set it up so that the data decodes automatically after a certain amount of time.
Anybody well versed in programming can do this. I had Hashida make the code.
Anyway, next we send the memory data through the net to the LHC in France.

Okabe: How long does it take to send 3.24 terabytes of data?

Kurisu: Next, we hijack the LHC, create a mini black hole, and use that black hole's supergravity to compress the data into 36 bytes.

Okabe: Will the compression take long?

Kurisu: By the way, the compression only holds in the immediate vicinity of the black hole. Once the data leaves that area, it will begin to decompress on its own.
This, too, takes 23 milliseconds.
And send it to the past.
This part is just like a D-Mail.
The phone sends out electrical impulses that pass through the temporal lobe and into the hippocampus, overwriting the recipient's memories.
At the same time, the phone sends impulses that stimulate the frontal lobe as well. This is important.
B-boobs!?

Daru: I was a boring little bastard who did nothing but study, what of it?
What? That sucks.

Kurisu: Um, since you need a phone to receive the signal, you can only send memories to the times you had one.
If that happens, your memories could overwrite theirs, which could obviously cause serious damage to their psyche.

Okabe: So.
What do we do with it?

Daru: Do with what?

Kurisu: It's too much for us to handle, that's for sure. The safest thing would be to hand it over to the government for professional research.

Daru: It just doesn't feel real.
That's 'cause you didn't work on it, Mayu-shi.

Mayuri: Oh, right. Ehehe!

Okabe: But there are still questions we need to answer.

Kurisu: It's hard to choose.
It's not like SERN's time machine. The possibility of becoming a jellyman is zero.
Don't let your preconceptions influence your decision.
You might say it's like a cut-and-paste of your brain.
Actually, it's more like a copy-paste. And it's just your memories.
The original doesn't get erased.
...I suppose.
We don't know what happens when you time leap.
I'm talking hypothetically. Titor doesn't matter right now.


Daru: Wouldn't it be a third party? Like me, or Mayu-shi.

Kurisu: This Time Leap Machine only sends memories. That, I guarantee.

Daru: Won't the present be reconstructed at the moment of transfer?
I'm getting confused.

Kurisu: Wait. You guys are misunderstanding something.
...Well, I can't. Nobody's tried it before.
This experiment may end up shattering preconceptions scientists and philosophers have held for centuries.

Mayuri: Hey...
Um, I have an idea...

Kurisu: Oh Mayuri...

Mayuri: Oh... you need a brain, huh...

Kurisu: 
Upset?
No, I'm not upset.
Uh, what are you doing?
I'm not grateful to you or anything, okay!?
Anyway.
That 'thank you' was just a formality. Don't get me wrong, okay?

Okabe: Of course. I only did what I had to.
I am the founder of the Future Gadget Lab, Hououin Kyouma. My first priority is to protect the welfare of my lab mems.
So I have no need for your thanks.

Kurisu: And yet you always talk about plunging the world into chaos.

Okabe: You are my allies, and the world is my enemy.

Kurisu: I'm speechless. You're too self-righteous.

Okabe: You say 'speechless,' yet you're speaking?

Kurisu: Don't argue semantics.
Oh yeah, I forgot to get a plane ticket.
I got too caught up in improving the PhoneWave.

Okabe: Going public with the Time Leap Machine will send the world into an uproar. We also plan to expose SERN, remember? You may not be able to go back to America for some time.

Kurisu: I guess you're right. I should call Mama and let her know.

Okabe: Daru, why did you order the exact same pizza as before!?

Mayuri: Okarin, Okarin.
I called Feris-chan and Luka-chan, but they said they couldn't come.
Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament.

Daru: Crap, I should've gone to cheer! How careless of me!

Kurisu: Maybe she thinks you'll make her wear a costume again.

Mayuri: She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her 'Cuteness is Justice', but she never listens.

Kurisu: 'Cuteness is Justice'... is that what they say?

Mayuri: You're cute too, Chris-chan!

Kurisu: Hah? Eh?

Mayuri: Hey, ComiMa's coming up. Wanna go?

Kurisu: Me, cosplay?
I'm sorta interested.

Mayuri: You don't have to show anyone, but eventually, you'll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!
That reminds me. Chris-chan, you're always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?

Kurisu: Oh, this?


Mayuri: Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪

Kurisu: Sure.

Daru: When's the photo shoot?

Kurisu: Good to know you're still a pervert, Hashida.

Daru: It means her panties are completely exposed!

Kurisu: N-no way...

Mayuri: It's okay♪
'They're not panties, so it's not embarrassing!'

Kurisu: It's plenty embarrassing, trust me!

Mayuri: Oh yeah. I should call home.

Okabe: 

Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro. I need to know.
Okay.
I just remembered I've got something to do. I'm going out.

Kurisu: What's wrong with her?
We may have created a monster here...

Moeka: Come with us. Now.

Mayuri: 

Okabe: Gah!

Kurisu: Mayuri! No!

Moeka: For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB...

Daru: Wahhhhhhhhhhh!

Mayuri: O...kari...

Kurisu: No... no!

Moeka: You three come with us. Now.

Okabe: Ah... AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Kurisu: Okabe!

Okabe: Let me go! Let me go!

Kurisu: You can't! They'll kill you!

Okabe: You gonna kill me too!?

Kurisu: Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay?

Attacker　A: Who the hell!?
Gwah!!

Moeka: Enough.

Suzuha: !!
That's my line!

Kurisu: Okabe...

Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro! One of them's moving!

Moeka: Kill them!

Kurisu: Augh!

Okabe: Kurisu!?

Kurisu: Ugh, gh, Okabe!! Are you sure!?
Are you sure about this!? Really!?

Okabe: Agh!
Leaaaaaaaap!!
Mayuri?
Mayuri?

Mayuri: 

Okabe: I won't let you go.
T-there is no escaping me! Muhaha, muhahaha!
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Aagh, ahhhh!!
Ah!
...

Kurisu: Okabe? Are you listening?
What was all that screaming for?
Then get ready to go already. We're going shopping, remember?
'Humans are temporal beings.'

Mayuri: But now you're fine.

Kurisu: Are you sure about this!? Really!?

Okabe: Ah... ah...

Kurisu: You'll remember the future.

Okabe: Where am I?

Kurisu: Huh?

Okabe: What time is it now!? What month? What day!?

Kurisu: Hey, that hurts! Calm down!

Okabe: Oh. Do they have plans?

Mayuri: Feris-chan has a RaiNet tournament.

Daru: Crap, I should've gone to cheer! How careless of me!

Kurisu: Maybe she thinks you'll make her wear a costume again.

Okabe: You still haven't convinced her to cosplay?

Mayuri: She said it was embarrassing. I keep telling her 'Cuteness is Justice', but she never listens...

Kurisu: 'Cuteness is Justice'... is that what they say?

Mayuri: You're cute too, Chris-chan!

Kurisu: Hah? Eh?

Mayuri: Hey, ComiMa's coming up. Wanna go?

Kurisu: Me, cosplay?
I'm sorta interested.

Mayuri: You don't have to show anyone, but eventually, you'll want them to see. The cosplay demon compels you!
That reminds me. Chris-chan, you're always wearing that cute uniform. What school is it from?

Kurisu: Oh, this?

Mayuri: Oh! Their uniform is really cute, but you made it even cuter! You might have really good design sense♪

Kurisu: Sure.

Daru: When's the photo shoot?

Kurisu: Good to know you're still a pervert, Hashida.

Daru: It means her panties are completely exposed!

Kurisu: N-no way...

Mayuri: It's okay♪
'They're not panties, so it's not embarrassing!'

Kurisu: Japan is over...

Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro. I need to know.
Are you listening?

Daru: Uh, the Time Leap Machine's done.

Suzuha: Okay.

Kurisu: What's wrong with her?

Moeka: For SERN... for FB... for SERN... for FB...

Daru: Wahhhhhhhhhhh!

Mayuri: O...kari...

Kurisu: No... no!

Moeka: You three come with us. Now.

Kurisu: Okabe!

Okabe: You gonna kill me too!?

Kurisu: Please, Okabe, do what she says. Okay?

Moeka: Enough.

Suzuha: !!

Moeka: Don't move!

Kurisu: Okabe, I--

Suzuha: Okabe Rintaro! One of them's headed your way!

Kurisu: Are you sure, Okabe!?
Are you sure about this!? Really!?

Okabe: Please! Give me one more chance!
Ah!
...Gh.

Kurisu: Kya! You surprised me!
Don't startle me like that.

Okabe: Daru! Is it just before 5 on the 13th!?

Daru: Eh? Um... yeah?

Okabe: You're a genius.

Kurisu: W-what's gotten in to you? Stop manhandling me. It's gross.

Okabe: Mayuri! Where are--


Okabe: Mayuri! Contact me at once! Okay? At once!

Kurisu: Okabe? You look kind of crazy. What's wrong?
...What's this about?
Okabe! Where are you going? Hey!

Okabe: Why... why did you kill her!?

Moeka: !?

Okabe: Of course I should.
Mayuri's dead, remember?
Gah!

Kurisu: Wha!?
Don't shout...



Okabe: Lukako! It's me! Okabe!
Is Mayuri there? If she is, let me speak to her!
Where are you now? Yanabayashi Shrine!?
I'm headed there now. Whatever you do, don't move, okay!?

Kurisu: What's all the commotion?

Okabe: Daru. Assistant. Leave right now and get as far from Akiba as you can. But under no circumstances use the train.

Daru: What? Why?
Wait, overnight? So you're saying we should go to a love hotel and make hanky panky. I understand.

Kurisu: Shut it, perv.

Attacker　A: Target B in custody. Requesting pickup.

Okabe: Aaaaahhhhhh!!

Mayuri: Okarin!
Ah!

Kurisu: Stop, Okabe! What are you doing!?
Are you trying to break the machine?

You look pale. What's wrong?
W-wait!
Hey. Don't you think you're a little old to be sitting on the ground in public?
So this is where you went. I've been looking for you.
You get a phone call, and suddenly you're like a different person.
If you know that Mayuri's going to die, then what are you doing wasting time here?
Based on what you said, I guess the chronology protection conjecture is true.
And that's why you keep time leaping...
Even if the machine works perfectly, repeated use may have serious side effects.
It happens all the time in sci-fi. You'll become trapped in a closed time loop, never aging, never dying, but doomed to repeat the same day for all eternity.
Every trace of your existence will vanish. Nobody will remember you, because your life will have never happened.
Heidegger. I was thinking of that quote too.
If what you said is true, then I want to save Mayuri too.
You're such a stubborn fool.
I'll help.
Mayuri's my friend, and a fellow lab mem.
Don't apologize.
Now it's my turn to return the favor.
Hey. Aren't you supposed to go 'muhahahaha' or something?
Anyway, I'm not doing this for you, okay?
That, and I think you'll make a good test subject.
I only experiment on you.
I-it's just a joke. Don't take it so seriously.
There's not much time. I think you should have a clear plan before trying to change the future again.
Leap to an even earlier time.
Let's go.
I understand why you can't tell Mayuri, but why can't you tell Hashida?
They'll throw you in the slammer for breaking and entering.
I see. That's how it looks from your perspective.
...
It's nothing. I was just thinking.
Nobody likes a man who can't remember dates.
Be thankful that I make a habit of checking the time. I have a pretty good idea what happened when.
Listen, Okabe. If you're going to keep using the Time Leap Machine, there's one thing you must remember.
But if you lose your phone... if someone else gets ahold of it...
Once again, never let go of your phone.
As soon as I finish, declare that we will not experiment. Then send everyone home.
Who knows me better than myself?
Don't forget. It was my mad skillz that turned the PhoneWave into a time leap machine.
Just to be safe, I should probably give you a passphrase.
It doesn't mean anything, okay!?
Be careful. And remember...

Mayuri: Fwapp!

Daru: I got a fwapp!

Mayuri: Okay! Thanks.
I finished before Chris-chan! We were racing.

Kurisu: Complete.

Okabe: We're not experimenting.

Kurisu: Eh!?
I just finished and you're already shutting it down? What I have been doing these past three days?
H-huh. That's... an unusually respectable opinion, coming from you.

Mayuri: Problems? I thought it was done?

Daru: We're not going to have a party to celebrate?

Kurisu: What?
...
What made you think I'd believe something like that!?
Don't be ridiculous. I would never make such a baseless projection.

Okabe: When I told you about my time leap, you said, 'I took it as proof that my theories were right. I didn't doubt it was true for a second.'

Kurisu: I don't talk like that!
Wha--
S-she said that? I'm gonna kill myself five hours from now...
It feels like someone peeked into my heart. And that someone is Okabe, of all people.
But I think I believe you. Tell me the details.
I see... If what you say is true, then we have a serious problem.
Future me said that the chronology protection conjecture holds, but I don't think that's quite right.
But when you time leap, there's no chance of a time paradox occurring.
Neither can I. The world is trying to kill Mayuri? As I scientist, I refuse to believe such nonsense.
The many-worlds interpretation... That might have something to do with how Mayuri's means of death keeps changing.
This is no time for your chuunibyou nonsense.
You've mentioned that Reading Steiner thing before. Were you actually serious?
Time leaping won't change the result. I just said that.
Getting emotional won't solve anything.
But it's not like I don't believe you.
Maybe Kiryu Moeka shooting her isn't the real cause of her death. Maybe it's something larger and less obvious.
Oh, right... hmm...
Anyway, the principle of causality is absolute. Deny that, and you deny all of physics.
Not necessarily.
No. It's still theoretical, but I believe that one leap with our machine has a maximum range of 48 hours.
Before what? I just finished the Time Leap Machine, remember?
Oh, so that's what you mean. Maybe she just didn't have the chance.
I don't know. Even I don't understand everything that's going on inside that thing.
Weren't you listening? I said, as long as the Time Leap Machine exists.
Exactly. An hour ago. August 13th, 2010. 2:00 PM, or thereabouts.
Most likely.
And if we go looking, I'm pretty sure SERN would crush us.

Okabe: Huh?
Hey!

Kurisu: Hey! Where are you going!?

Okabe: What do you know?

Suzuha: I thought it was my fault.
...Is it true!?
...
...Thanks.

Mayuri: Welcome back, Okarin! Oh! Suzu-san's with you too♪
So Daru-kun and I went shopping♪

Kurisu: W-what do we do?

Daru: What are you guys whispering about?

Kurisu: Um...

Mayuri: What year were you born?
That's in seven years... You haven't been born yet, but you're here. Uh... huh???

Okabe: Alright, Suzuha. Let's hear it.

Mayuri: Diss-tope-ear?

Kurisu: A society where every activity is controlled by the government. In a dystopia, you're not allowed to eat bananas unless today is banana-eating day. If you break that rule, they throw you in jail without a trial.

Mayuri: That's terrible! Mayushii loves bananas...

Suzuha: I'm part of the Resistance fighting to free humanity from SERN's control.

Mayuri: Um, what about finding your father? Was that a lie?

Kurisu: SERN is a research institution. They don't have political power. I explained that to John Titor several times online.
Titor came forward, so it's only fair that I do too.


Mayuri: Ah, you harmonized♪

Suzuha: SERN is still a research institution in 2036.
When SERN successfully completed their time machine, they became the sole entity with power over the fourth dimension, Time.
That brings us to you, Makise Kurisu.
In 2036, you're apotheosized as the mother of the time machine.

Kurisu: Apotheosized?

Suzuha: Apotheosized. As in revered, respected.

Kurisu: Respected? Huh!? I-I am!?
I help SERN build their time machine? I don't believe it.

Suzuha: But that's how it is in the future.

Kurisu: How did the future me explain herself?
Well... that's just great.

Suzuha: In my time, there are two kinds of people: those who live extremely long lives, and those who die young, under suspicious circumstances.

Kurisu: T-they erased me?

Suzuha: Maybe you were being used by SERN too. Maybe they took your parents hostage and forced you to work on their time machine.

Kurisu: No... does that mean Mama's in danger?

Suzuha: On paper, they're an independent technology research firm. In reality, they do the dirty work for SERN all over the world.

Daru: D-dirty work? Does that mean like... kidnappings and assassinations?

Suzuha: 

Kurisu: Amane-san. You said that most of what you posted as John Titor was true, right?

Suzuha: Right.
That was a lie. Camouflage so that SERN wouldn't target me.

Kurisu: Really? Tell me!

Suzuha: Right. I told you by mail, didn't I?

Kurisu: What sort of model is that?

Suzuha: Countless possible worldlines exist side by side, branching out to infinity.


Daru: Can you compare it to an eroge? Teach me, oh erotic one.

Kurisu: T-there's no erotic one here!
You guys are hopeless. Better do something quick.

Suzuha: Umm, I don't know what you guys are talking about...
We have to escape Attractor Field Alpha.

Kurisu: I thought attractor fields couldn't interact.

Mayuri: Umm, what happened those years?

Suzuha: Events that changed the face of the world.
The Year 2000 Problem.
And that brings us to 2010.

Mayuri: Did something big happen this year?
Oh yeah! Wow!

Kurisu: One more question.


Suzuha: No. Ultimately, they're just possibilities that exist simultaneously.

Okabe: Reading Steiner!?

Kurisu: Wait a second.
How do we know this is all true? What if Amane-san is just making stuff up?

Suzuha: What!? I'm not making stuff up!

Kurisu: Calm down. I'm not trying to pick a fight.
Don't you know a little too much for someone born in 2017?

Suzuha: It was written in Dad's will.

Mayuri: What do you mean?

Suzuha: His will was what made me decide to time travel.
But SERN killed him.

Kurisu: I'm sorry.

Suzuha: Akihabara, 2010. The time machine created here accelerates SERN's own time machine research.

Daru: Stop it? How?

Suzuha: Dad believed that the ultimate cause was the very first email you sent with your time machine.

Kurisu: Which email are you talking about?

Suzuha: The IBN 5100.

Daru: Oh!
Uh... we never had one?
Huh?

Suzuha: My mission is to make sure you acquire an IBN 5100.
I'm going to 1975 to obtain one.
I was trying to leave when you caught me, but...

Kurisu: Can you fix it?
Maybe we can use the Time Leap Machine to go back before Amane-san's time machine broke.

Daru: Wait, you're going to use the Time Leap Machine? Wasn't the plan not to experiment?

Suzuha: That wasn't a crash. The coordinates were slightly off, so it just appeared there.

Kurisu: The morning of the 10th. Just before dawn.

Mayuri: Mayushii's hungry!
Wow, Okarin! What are we going to do with all this money?

Okabe: Christina. Titor.

Suzuha: Titor? Is that me?

Kurisu: Just give up. Okabe rarely calls anyone by their name.

Suzuha: Oh yeah. He always calls me 'Part-Time Warrior' for some reason.
...I'm sorry.

Okabe: Good. Then let's begin.

Kurisu: You're not going to name the operation?
You couldn't find a good Norse mythology-themed name?

Suzuha: Why Norse mythology?

Kurisu: I don't think there's a deep meaning behind it. Chuunibyou patients just love Germanic names for some reason.

Suzuha: Shiina Mayuri... you're such a nice girl...
...You're right.
I know that he was in Akihabara in 2010.
Of course he is! At this age, he's probably still young and cool.

Mayuri: Wow, a foreigner?

Suzuha: I... don't know his real name.
He died before he could tell me.

Kurisu: So you have no leads?

Daru: It's built kind of like the PhoneWave.
It's hacker! How many times do I have to tell you!?
No promises, man. And why two days?

Suzuha: In two days, the weather conditions will be perfect for creating the ring singularity.

Daru: Fix it in two days? That's just nuts.
...!?
No problem!

Kurisu: Welcome back.
He hasn't come back yet. It's already dark, so maybe he went straight home?

Suzuha: I feel bad. There's no time for this...

Okabe: Is it SERN!?

Kurisu: Good morning.

Okabe: You came to wake me up? Thanks.

Suzuha: I asked her to wake you up, Okabe Rintaro. There's something I want to show you.

Okabe: What's this?
You made this?

Kurisu: How exactly does it work? It shouldn't be possible to measure changes like that.

Suzuha: I don't know either.
You did, Okabe Rintaro.

Kurisu: So this meter lets other people check worldline divergence?

Suzuha: I wish.

Kurisu: What? Then there's no point. Make something useful for once, Okabe.

Okabe: !?

Policeman: What are these leaflets about? Let's talk at the station.

Mayuri: Ehh?

Kurisu: Hey, Okabe, remember the lifter? I don't suppose you've figured out what it is... no, of course you haven't.

Okabe: I already know. It's the 42-inch CRT downstairs.

Kurisu: R-really? What's your proof?
...Oh, right. The CRT... I see...

Mayuri: I'm sorry, guys. I made things worse...


Okabe: Assistant? It's me.
What are you saying? It's me, Hououin Kyouma.
Would you prefer to be called 'KuriGohan and Kamehameha'?


Okabe: 
...How are things there?
I'll be right there.

Kurisu: For your information, I don't post t...ti...
I don't post pictures of my chest, okay!?

Suzuha: Kurigohan and Kamehameha... so you're the one who kept picking fights with me on the internet. Makes sense.

Kurisu: I thought you wanted an open discussion.
Hehehe...

Suzuha: Ahaha!

Kurisu: I think you probably forgot, so I wanted to make sure just in case.
Have you been looking for the lifter? You haven't, have you?

Okabe: I already know. It's the 42-inch CRT downstairs.

Kurisu: R-really? What's your proof?
I see...
What? Don't apologize. It's creepy.
How rude.
I just don't trust people who claim it can be done despite how unrealistic it is.
Besides, I can hardly deny it with evidence staring me in the face.
Anyway. If you're apologizing, that must mean you helped out the first time.
Then don't worry about it. I wouldn't want you to have to do it all over again.

Suzuha: Sorry.

Kurisu: Don't you apologize now. It's weird.

Suzuha: Hashida Itaru's amazing. He said if things go well, he could have the time machine fixed by tomorrow.
All these people who lived before I was born are working so hard for my sake.
There's no individuality. Everyone's a robot.
Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great.
...Thanks.

Okabe: It's me.
SERN!?
Identify yourself.
What are you saying?
Identified. NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'll head there right now!

Master: Oh! Okaabee! Hello!

Kurisu: Done.

Suzuha: So that's the Time Leap Machine...
Intuition... sixth sense... deja vu...
Some of SERN's researchers in my time came up with the theory that memories are a way of sharing information across worldlines.

Kurisu: I just wish we knew more about Okabe's Reading Steiner thing.
I still don't understand why that is. It would make more sense if you experienced a change in the present, like you do when we send a D-Mail.

Suzuha: The problem is that consciousness doesn't have a form that we can see.

Kurisu: I see... that's a little disappointing.

Suzuha: That's not how it works.
When you leap into the past and take different actions from before, divergence changes, if only a little bit.
When you change the cause, the effect merely shifts to a separate, already-existing worldline.

Kurisu: That's the many-worlds interpretation, right?

Okabe: He's worried about you.

Suzuha: It doesn't matter how I feel.
I'll go anyway.
But still... I don't want the future to turn out like that.
Maybe I don't have the right... but I'm going anyway.
Aw, come on! The 70s aren't a bad time, you know? I'll find friends there just like you guys. We'll have a blast!
Thanks, guys... really. I can't thank you enough.

Mayuri: Don't forget about us!

Kurisu: Control yourself, perv.

Suzuha: Oh right. Take this.
This is for you, Okabe Rintaro. Keep it in the lab, will you? Somewhere out of sight is fine.

Daru: Why don't we make duplicates for all the lab mems? Make it our symbol, I guess.

Mayuri: Wow! That's a great idea!

Kurisu: How unusually thoughtful of you.

Mayuri: Okay everyone! Dahdahdahdah! Mayushii has an important announcement to make!

Okabe: Huh?

Mayuri: Wanna meet him? You do, dontcha? Well, he's here with us today!
Allow me to introduce you! Suzu-san's dad is...
Tada! Suzu-san's dad is...
Daru-kun!

Kurisu: That joke's not even logical. It's impossible for this perv to get married in the first place.

Mayuri: Geez. You're all so mean to Daru-kun.

Daru: Mayu-shi's the only one to stand up for me. You're an angel, Mayu-shi. Do you love me?

Mayuri: Nope.


Kurisu: Okay. What's your proof?

Mayuri: Um, I was thinking about the letters on Suzu-san's pin...
After staring at it really hard, I noticed the 7 in '7010' looked a little weird.

Suzuha: R-really?
It's so small, I can't tell...

Mayuri: And you know, Suzu-san has lots of stories about future Okarin and future Chris-chan, but not a single story about Daru-kun, right?
Well, Mayushii's a lab mem, but I can't make time machines, and I don't like fighting. Of course I'm not famous!

Kurisu: So you're saying he used a different name?

Mayuri: And then there's the time machine's name, FG204 something something... umm, what was it?

Suzuha: FG204 2nd EDITION ver. 2.31.

Mayuri: And FG probably stands for Future Gadget.

Kurisu: Come to think of it, last night, Mayuri asked how to say 'barrel' in Japanese.

Mayuri: Okay, Suzu-san! Say 'Hashida Itaru' ten times fast!

Suzuha: HashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaruHashidaItaru

Mayuri: Just now, didn't it sound like 'Ditor'?

Kurisu: It did.

Daru: For reals?

Mayuri: For super reals♪
I think she looks just like her father♪


Daru: 
I'm watching. Of course I am!
B-by the way, was your mother cute? Request petite girl with cute face and big boobs.

Suzuha: Ahaha. That's a secret.
Well! That takes care of everything I wanted to do on this worldline.
Guess I should be going.
I'll bring it to you here in Akihabara. That's my duty, and I'll see it through. The rest is up to you.
Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it'll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha!

Okabe: Suzuha...

Kurisu: Haah, whew... whew... no more... running...

Daru: Suzuha's 54 by now, right?

Kurisu: You know, it wouldn't be unusual for her to have grandchildren by that age.

Mayuri: Just be super nice to them! That's what grandpas do!

Tennouji: Okabe!

Mayuri: If you're looking for Suzu-san, she went 35 years--

Kurisu: Shaddup, Mayuri!

Mayuri: Eh? Eh? Is it from Suzu-san?

Suzuha: 
























































Okabe: Daru... didn't you fix the time machine?

Kurisu: Calm down, both of you. Hashida did everything he could. He doesn't deserve your anger, Okabe.

Okabe: Mister Braun!

Tennouji: Okabe! Did you hear? That satellite up and disappeared. Everyone's talking about it.
...Why do you wanna know that?
It was suicide.
She hung herself at home. I was the one who found her.
She became unstable about a year before it happened. Before that, she was a nice, cheerful lady.

Mayuri: Okarin, are you okay?

Kurisu: What are you doing, Okabe!?

Mayuri: But Okarin, are you sure?

Okabe: Kurisu. You're good at remembering dates, aren't you?

Kurisu: Huh? Well, sure...
Four days ago. August 9th.

Mayuri: Are you sure!?

Suzuha: Being with you guys, even for just a little while... was great.
I'm going to finish what you started, Dad. I promise.
Well, see you in 35 years... though I guess it'll only be a few hours for you guys. Ahaha!
Change the future. Please.

Kurisu: Do you have a plan?

Okabe: ah.

Kurisu: see? You're shaking. We've only been at it for two days and you're already exhausted.
We still have plenty of time to find the pin. You don't have to be in such a hurry.
Take care of yourself. Got it?

Daru: Th-that was close!
Holy Land, I have returned!

Mayuri: Wow... I've never seen it this empty...
Hey! Mayushii's hungry!

Daru: Isn't there a restaurant nearby? Let's take a break.

Kurisu: I can't believe we have to bike all the way back. What a nightmare...

Daru: Whoa!
Th-that was close!
Holy Land, I have returned!

Mayuri: Wow... I've never seen it this empty...
Hey! Mayushii's hungry!

Daru: Isn't there a restaurant nearby? Let's take a break.

Kurisu: I can't believe we have to bike all the way back. What a nightmare...

Okabe: It's gone...

Daru: Huh? Uh... I don't think so?
Hmm, doesn't look stopped.
Are you waiting for someone? You keep looking out the window.

Okabe: Mayuri. Kurisu.

Kurisu: Wait... did you just say my name correctly?

Mayuri: Okeydokey!

Kurisu: I don't need an escort from you. I can get back by myself.

Okabe: Mister Braun gave it to me. It's a device that can measure the divergence of worldlines.

Mayuri: Wow, that sounds amazing... what's a worldline?

Okabe: Mayuri, you really are a dummy.
Just a thought, Mayuri, but don't you think maybe you should stop coming to Akiba for a while? At least until ComiMa ends.
Mayuri!?

Kurisu: So you're the devoted type, huh?
All of a sudden, you're treating Mayuri like a princess.

Mayuri: Okarin really loves Mayushii! Ehehe!

Kurisu: So what's the deal?
Huh!? Uh... well... umm...

Mayuri: Mwawoohii's weeally hwawy nawo.

Kurisu: So... you're not a couple. Oh. Well, of course! No one would willingly date Okabe, after all.

Okabe: Pff. You disappoint me, Christina!

Kurisu: Hah? What are you talking about?
What the hell are you on about, you self-proclaimed mad scientist chuunibyou nutcase?

Okabe: 

Suzuha: The universe is like this piece of yarn.
When the meter reads over 1%, you've made it to the Beta worldline.
If you escape the Alpha attractor field and reach the Beta worldline... then the result will change.
Reach 1% divergence... and you'll save Shiina Mayuri.

Kurisu: Okabe.
In case what?

Mayuri: Augh!

Okabe: Mayu--

Mayuri: O...kari...

Kurisu: Stop! Stop!

Okabe: Ah!

Mayuri: Okarin? You want a banana too?

Okabe: Kurisu, come with me a second.

Kurisu: What is it? You don't normally say my name normally.
That came out weird.

Okabe: Please... help me.

Kurisu: Now this is a shock.
I never thought I'd hear those words from you. Do you have a fever?

Okabe: No jokes. I seriously need your help.

Kurisu: You time leaped, didn't you?

Okabe: How much do you know?

Kurisu: How much do I know about what?

Okabe: How about Suzuha being John Titor?

Kurisu: Eh!?
It never even occurred to me.

Okabe: 
Have you finished the Time Leap Machine?

Kurisu: What are you talking about? I finished it yesterday after an all-nighter, remember?
Hmmm...
So basically, you win if you get the IBN 5100 back.
This is just a guess...
I think the critical change takes place when you get the IBN 5100 and erase the data in SERN's database.
You've already found it once. That is, if your memories are real.
If you can get back to the worldline where you first obtained it, then isn't it bound to return to you?
You threw a fit about that earlier. I remember thinking, 'Oh god, Okabe's finally lost his ability to distinguish fantasy from reality.'
That's terrible.
It's still a hypothesis. I only came to that conclusion based on your explanation.
You can't just blindly follow this hypothesis either.
Why did the IBN 5100 disappear? Which of the D-Mails caused its disappearance?
True, that is interesting. Maybe it's related to the change in divergence.
Anyway, it's important to act with discretion. Don't do anything careless.
...Don't die. Okay?
W-what!? Don't be ridiculous! Why should I care!?
I just don't want to lose a valuable test subject, that's all. Yeah!
I want to map your brain and find out just what's going on in there.
...
Oh. G-great.
Ah...
And besides, I don't even remember helping you before! How are you going to take responsibility for this!?
I wish I could remember too...
Then I'd always have something to rub your nose in!
You're one to talk.

Okabe: !

Viral Attacker A: Where are you!?

Okabe: You exposed us to the pursuers. They're right in front of us!

Kurisu: 


Okabe: Did you find it?
...Pardon my asking, but the PC was donated by Akiha Rumiho-san, correct?

Luka: 
...I don't know anything.

Mayuri: Tutturu♪ Welcome backarin.
Well, 'welcome back' flows so well into 'Okarin,' doesn't it? When you put them together, it's doubly delicious.
Hmm, probably at MayQueen?
'Course I do! You know that, Okarin. You're so weird!
Mayushii's taking a break to prepare for ComiMa tomorrow.

Kurisu: Okabe? What are you doing? I thought we weren't going to--

Okabe: Whew...
Hello? Daru?
Hey, what happened!? Daru!?
I won't let you kill Mayuri!
Whew...

Kurisu: This seems serious.
Delicacy? That's like the exact opposite of what anyone expects from you.
Oh, you.
Why do you need to ask a girl anyway?
Urushibara-san is actually a guy? That's totally ridiculous.
So basically, umm...
She looked like Hashida?


Kurisu: Unacceptable! There's no way such a cute girl was a guy.
He looked like she does now?
Acceptable.
Anyway. You want to turn her back into a guy?
Have you come up with a solution?
Regret won't change anything.
Don't say anything to Urushibara-san.
So you don't have to tell her -- him? Ex-him?
...You don't have to tell Urushibara-san. Just send the cancellation D-Mail.
If the worldline changes, then that will all be undone.
What!? Are you an idiot!? Why didn't you write it down!?
What if you just ask for the pager number directly? Think up a good excuse.
...Wow, I hate myself for saying that. I'm a bad girl.
It's more like you to say 'I'll brainwash her, muhahaha!'.

Okabe: I will shoulder Lukako's pain. That's my responsibility.

Kurisu: So what are you talking to me for? Go to her now, and tell her what you told me.

Okabe: You used to be a guy.

Luka: You're... saying that again? Sniff...
You're... joking, right?
This is more roleplaying, right? You're being Kyouma-san, right? Right?
Please tell me you're joking, Okabe-san...
And why do I have to hear it... from you, of all people?
So that's how you think of me...

Okabe: Lukako! Wait!!

Kurisu: You raised a flag.
Don't you get it? You raised a flag. Or I guess you could say you tripped over a flag that was already raised.

Okabe: You mean a death flag?

Kurisu: Why!? It's a romance flag, genius.
Urushibara-san likes you.
In other words, your plan was a massive failure.
Love is trouble. There's no formula for calculating people's feelings. Too many unknowns to solve for.
The direct approach was a mistake. It'll be even harder to persuade her now.
How should I know?
That's just your perspective.
Think in terms of the current worldline.
Anyway, there's a bigger problem.
So you're gradually approaching the original worldline.
I mean, there are six billion people in the world.
What did Amane-san have to say about that?
Maybe the divergence meter actually measures your distance to the IBN 5100...
Hmmm. So just cancel the D-Mails that activated Reading Steiner, and the IBN 5100 might come back to you.

Okabe: Kiryu Moeka.

Kurisu: Well, you tripped a romance flag, so...
...Ah!
B-by the way, Okabe. Is there... someone you like?
Oh... okay.
Ah, no, just wondering! There's no hidden meaning, okay!?
A-anyway! You should go out with Urushibara-san!
Just go out with her.
...Only consider this as a last resort.
She'll forget after the worldline changes, won't she? In that case, I think it's a valid option.
...I hate myself for suggesting this.

Mayuri: Okarin! How'd it go?
Huwha?


Mayuri: Waaah, Okarin's broken!
What are you doing?
Retreat...?

Kurisu: Stop staring. You're distracting me. How many times do I have to tell you?
...
What.

Luka: Okabe-san... and Makise-san. Did you come to pray?

Kurisu: A-ahem. Actually, we have something to talk to you about, Urushibara-san.

Luka: What might that be?

Kurisu: Did you know? Male and female brains are very different.

Luka: What...?

Kurisu: By the way, the right brain handles image processing, spacial processing, and comprehensive judgment. The left brain handles things like language, and calculation.
You know how people say that girls are better at multitasking? That can be explained by the development of the corpus callosum.
Actually, these theories are kinda fringe. They're not really that credible.

Luka: A-an experiment?

Kurisu: I want to try mapping your brain patterns to see if they're more female or male.
Brainwave mapping. We just take a sample of your brainwaves. Anyway, you'll understand if you try it. Okay? Okay? It won't hurt a bit.

Luka: N-no thanks...

Kurisu: Fwahn! Wh-what!?
I'm just treating her like a valuable test sub--

Mayuri: Is Chris-chan sleeping? She worked all night, so you shouldn't wake her up.
Chris-chan, tutturu♪

Luka: Until... the 15th...
P-please be my boyfriend!

Okabe: E-excuse me. I need a moment.


Luka: Ah...

Okabe: Wh-why are you crying!?
...

Luka: Um, Okabe-san?
Um... tomorrow... a da...
Eh...
I want to go where you want to go, Okabe-san...

Kurisu: Well?
You told me to watch, didn't you?
Yeah?

Okabe: What was that for!?

Kurisu: Anyway, do you have any plans for your date tomorrow?
Well, do you?
And?
You're obviously a virgin, thank you ver--
...Hah!?
...P-pretend you didn't just hear that.
S-sorry...
Ugh...
Shut up! What's wrong with being a virgin!?
...Hah!?
Ah... awhawha...
L-let's get out of here!
What's important for a first date is to make a good impression.
An unclean appearance is out of the question. A haircut is especially important. Long hair looks dirty, so it's no good.
For clothes, you should wear something exactly the right size. Though it may be trendy, especially in Akiba, for young men to wear baggy clothes, it looks sloppy, so it's not good.
On the first date, conversation tends to break due to mutual nervousness. What's important is to play 'conversation catch'.
One-sided conversations aren't fun for the other side. Girls especially like to talk, so the guy should try to keep the conversation going.
Not just by listening. Throwing in appropriate responses is also necessary. Responsiveness gives the girl the impression that you're really listening to her.
Basically, you need to be the opposite of yourself.
Anyway, focus on acting normal for now. No more of that idiotic laughter.
You're too heavy-handed with girls. You talk too pompously. You fire off nonsensical delusions.

Okabe: Hey! You're just reading out of a dating manual, so you've got no right to look down on me, you American virgin!

Kurisu: Who are you calling an American virgin?

Okabe: Who else but you?

Kurisu: Yeah, sure thing, virgin.
There's a saying. 'A fortress is judged by how many attacks it repulses; a soldier is judged by how many fortresses he takes.'

Okabe: That's not a saying. Don't look so proud of yourself.

Kurisu: You're right. This is a dumb argument.
Anyway, this dating manual actually says some pretty interesting things.
Like 'when walking down the street, be sure to put yourself between your date and the road' or 'whatever you do, don't make the girl pay for anything'. Okay! For your date tomorrow, make sure you follow all of these rules.
And after that, there's... carry a clean handkerchief. Spread it out when the girl goes to sit on a park bench.

Okabe: I'm not her butler.

Kurisu: But that's what the book says.
When it's time to eat, avoid fast food of all kinds. Family restaurants are borderline acceptable. Anything else depends on your budget.

Okabe: Family restaurants are borderline...

Kurisu: Arrive at the meeting place at least 15 minutes early. Tardiness is unacceptable.

Okabe: 15 minutes early...

Kurisu: Then you just need to decide where to take her. Movies, art galleries, strolling through town, and food are all safe.

Okabe: I see. It's easier than I thought.
I was under the impression that a first date required going to a beautiful beach resort, exchanging your first kiss bathed in the light of the setting sun, and stuff like that.

Kurisu: Ah, that's really romantic!
...I mean, that's virgin imagination at full throttle. You've read too much manga.

Okabe: You too.

Kurisu: Besides, your date's a minor, so don't even think about bringing her to a hotel, okay?

Okabe: What do you take me for?

Kurisu: That just about covers it. Well? Was my lecture helpful?

Faris: Nyanya? Kyouma, are you going on a date, nya?
Thanks for waiting! I'll prepare your iced coffee, nyan♪
Is Mayushii the lucky girl, nya?

Okabe: Why would you think that?

Faris: Hmmya? Not her, nya? Then...
Is it her, nya?

Kurisu: Hwehh...!

Okabe: No, she's my assistant.

Kurisu: 

Faris: Then some other girl, nya? Kyouma, you tomcat, you're making moves on too many girls, nya.

Kurisu: Oh-ho... So you're making moves on too many girls, huh?

Luka: Thank you.
I feel like it's been a long time since you last taught me, Kyouma-san.
...Thank goodness. You're back to your old self.
Um...
I... do remember.
I remember, or actually... umm, how should I say it...
I can't clearly remember it, but at the bottom of my sea of memories, well... in my head, umm...
I'm sorry I lied yesterday...
So because I remembered, I knew Mom's pager number without having to ask.
And... one more thing.
Yes... I think so...
...
Please come with me. I'll show you.

Okabe: The IBN 5100 is here?

Luka: Um... not there...
It happened last year, just before New Years...
I broke it by accident.
I used a pushcart from home. It... broke too.
When I heard Kyouma-san was searching for it, I was really surprised.
I know.
It's already been more than half a year, so the management probably took it away...
Ah... it's not locked...
...I'm sorry.
Um... there's something strange about my memories.
So there's no choice... I have to go back to being a guy.
So this is goodbye...
That doesn't matter.
...Please, save Mayuri-chan.
Ahaha... um, please, go already. If you don't... I might cry...
So, please...
Ah, this is when I use that phrase, right?
El Psy Kongroo.


Mayuri: Okarin? Is something wro--
Ah, guh, uh...

Daru: Mayu-shi...?
Mayu-shi! What's wrong!?
She's not breathing...
Okarin! There's something wrong with Mayu-shi!
Hey, Mayu-shi! Wake up! Where's the camera!? We're on candid camera, right!?
How can you be so calm!?
What...?

Okabe: I couldn't save you, Mayuri.

Kurisu: Okabe. It's been three days. Will you at least eat something?
I can make cup noodles, if you like. Or should I go get something?
I suppose I could, but why? It looks like you've already blamed yourself enough.
No one can blame you.
So accept what you've done.
However...

Mayuri is dead. It's sad -- no, sad doesn't even begin to describe it -- but Mayuri is gone.
You couldn't change convergence. You couldn't defy fate.
And I think she's suffering alone, just like you.

Luka's Father: It's gone. I couldn't find it anywhere.

Luka: Then shouldn't we report it to the police?
Um, Okabe-san. I don't really understand, but please don't be sad.

Mayuri: Phew. I'm stuffed! I barely ate today, so I was hungry!
Okeydokey! Mayushii's got an early day tomorrow, so I'm going home.
Hey guys, why don't you come too?

Kurisu: What!?
Hey! Don't put words in my mouth!

Mayuri: Come on, Chris-chan!

Kurisu: No way. I'd suffocate in a crowd like that.

Mayuri: It's not as crowded on day two! If you're worried, come in the afternoon. All the popular stuff will be sold out, though.

Kurisu: You go, Okabe. You're Mayuri's guardian, aren't you?
Oh, right. That's what it was.
What do you mean, business?
No answer? I guess it was just an excuse.

Mayuri: Whatcha gonna talk about?
Mayushii really wants to join in your secret meetings and stuff.
Oh, great! Thanks, Okarin.

Okabe: So, Christina.

Kurisu: 
You're acting weird today. What's going on?
You're time leaping?
...I think I get it.
Don't wear yourself out.
Why are you always like that!? I'm even trying to be nice. You're really full of yourself, you know?
Okabe...
I can't believe there's nothing we can do.
...Are you okay?
I know. That's not what I meant.
You're carrying an awful burden.
Then why don't you time leap now?
I don't want to see Mayuri die either, you know.

Okabe: I know how you feel, but you're the only one I can ask.

Kurisu: Where did all this trust come from?
You're so full of yourself.

Male　Staff-Member: We don't have an employee by that name.

Okabe: Excuse me. Did the person who lives there move?
What...?
Time leap...
Electrical discharge!?
...
In other words... I have nothing.
...!
Hello!?


Okabe: Hey, can you hear me? Hey!

Moeka: 
Why won't you respond, FB? You're the one who recruited me...

Okabe: Dammit.
Hello?
Hello.
...Sorry, I'm busy.
Is that the first thing that comes to mind? You really are a mainstream girl.


Okabe: Get Daru to help. I can't do it today.
Kiryu Moeka's apartment.


Okabe: You've seen too many Hollywood movies.


Moeka: Gah...hah...

Okabe: Now I have your attention!
If you don't, I'll kill you!

Moeka: Guh, hgg, gah, hah, geh...!
Guh!
Ah... gah...!
Gehohgehohgehoh, khah, ga... beh.. gh...
Gehohgehoh, bi...na...


Okabe: Get ready for a D-Mail!
I'm having a little trouble here.


Okabe: And Mayuri?
You didn't tell her anything, did you?
Good. Don't hang up yet.
...
What? Why?
Well!?
Yes. Did it work!?
So it worked, right?
The worldline didn't change!
Maybe the message wasn't enough to persuade Moeka to change models.
It's July 31st. I'm sure of it.
What a pain!


Okabe: You're a lifesaver. What's going on there? Is Mister Braun freaking out?
Are you there?
I tried two more times, but nothing.


Okabe: Nothing... changed?
No way...
She's crazy!


Okabe: Didn't you wonder why?

Moeka: Don't say that! She's not... like that!
The coin locker... in front of Daibiru...
*sob*...

Okabe: I'm using your phone.


Okabe: You at the lab?
What, were you worried about me?
Where are you now?
Set up the machine. I'm sending another D-Mail.
...July 31st, 11 AM.


Okabe: Alright, activate it.
...
Nothing. Why won't it change!?
No, there's no way! I know what Moeka's message said. This D-Mail should have canceled it.
That the IBN 5100 was at Yanabayashi Shrine. I tried to cancel it by telling her it's a trap, but it didn't work.


Okabe: It's them!

Moeka: 
What now?

Okabe: Tennouji's wife might be FB.

Kurisu: 
I thought I asked you to keep me posted.

Okabe: Were you worried about me?

Kurisu: O-of course not! Why should I care what you're up to?
It's just... Mayuri was really worried. I don't want to see her sad.

Okabe: I'm doing this to save Mayuri.

Kurisu: Our enemy? But...
Isn't she our enemy?
Whatever. So where are you going now? Take me with you.
Eh...
Do I die today?
Then there's no problem. This worldline has essentially guaranteed my survival.

Tennouji: Yeah, I am.
Recruiting members directly is bad for secrecy, but the Rounders make up for it by choosing expendable assets with nowhere else to go.
As soon as our job's done, they get rid of us. Guess that makes us cattle, not dogs.
Disobey orders, and they go after your family. I can't let them touch my little girl, can I?
Sorry for everything, Suzu-san.

Moeka: Ah...ah...
No... why...

Okabe: 
You left your daughter all alone!
...She's gone?
...His phone.

Kurisu: So the manager was FB.

Okabe: Hey, Moeka...

Kurisu: Okabe! We need to send the D-Mail now.
Your goal is to save Mayuri, not take revenge on SERN. Right?
I'll try calling.
He said he'll be there in five minutes.
By the way, something weird happened back there.

Okabe: Her... who?

Kurisu: Nae-chan.

Okabe: Wait! Don't--

Nae: Hi!
...
Aha!
Yes way.
Aha! Ahaha!

Okabe: 

Kurisu: Calm down!
No, wait! Before that...

Okabe: Moeka!

Moeka: I... k...ed...
I... killed...
I had... nothing... except FB...

Kurisu: Okabe.
Based on the attractor field model you spoke of...
...Sorry. I wish I knew what to say.

Okabe: 

Tennouji: Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we're more like cattle than dogs.

Nae: I won't forgive you, until I kill you with my own hands.

Kurisu: Okabe?
...She was like a different person.
Don't worry about it, Okabe.
Our enemy? But...
Isn't she our enemy?
Huh?
...!

Okabe: Gah, gwaaah...!

Nae: There's nothing for me there...
I don't need anything from you now.

Okabe: Hahaha...

Kurisu: Okabe!
What happened!? Are you okay!?
Hey, tell me what happened, will you!?
R-right. If the worldline changes, then this wound will go away.

Okabe: Hey... why do you think Tennouji didn't kill Moeka?

Kurisu: What do you mean?

Tennouji: Doing your duty sets you up for disposal. So we're more like cattle than dogs.

Nae: Live in fear and regret, Okabe Rintaro. Until we meet again in fifteen years.

Okabe: Have you been to Kiryu Moeka's apartment?

Kurisu: Huh?
Moeka-san's apartment? Never.

Okabe: Oh, okay.

Kurisu: Why do you ask?

Okabe: It doesn't matter. Just wondering.
It's here!
Daru! Daru! Where's my super hacka!?

Kurisu: Uh, he's not here.
He went to ComiMa, remember?

Okabe: Daru! Christina!
It's time for the final phase of Operation Verthandi!

Daru: Yeah?

Kurisu: Let me sleep, for crying out loud.

Okabe: A question, Daru. Have you researched how to use the IBN 5100?

Daru: Huh? Well, yeah, I guess.
Hell no.

Kurisu: Will you guys shut up? You're giving me a headache.

Okabe: Hear me, lab mems!

Kurisu: Argh! Shut up!

Daru: Nobody can know the darkness in Okarin's heart...
I guess he just got caught up in the heat of the moment. Maybe he regrets it now.

Kurisu: Uh, I don't think that's a good idea.
Okabe...

Okabe: Please!

Daru: I-it's not like I'm cracking for you or anything, okay!?

Kurisu: Oh god...

Okabe: This all happened because of the very first D-Mail I sent to Daru.


Kurisu: Fascinating.
O-of course it did.
Besides, we were already planning to crack SERN's database, weren't we?
Uh, you lost me.

Daru: Done bridging them. I need to tinker with the settings a little, but we should be up and running in about ten minutes.

Kurisu: So the first D-Mail started everything...
The one that said I died or something.

Okabe: Right. I found you dead at Radio Kaikan and sent Daru an email. Daru happened to be experimenting on the PhoneWave (name subject to change) at the time, so the discharge phenomenon occurred and the mail... was...
...!

Kurisu: What?

Okabe: !?
Mayuri!

Mayuri: O...kari...
Finally... Mayushii was...

Okabe: Mayuri...

Kurisu: There you are.
What are you doing here?
H-hey! Is that how you treat someone who's worried about you?
N-not that I'm worried about you or anything!
I was going to leave you alone at first.
You look like a kid forced to eat crappy oatmeal. What happened?
Then why did you cancel the cracking of SERN?
Oh, so you're afraid of triggering arrest flags. I get it.
...!
...Which friend to let die? What are you talking about?
Uh... I may have figured that out when we first met.
Tell me, Okabe. What do you mean?
Don't hold back now.
...eh?
...
Hey, Okabe.
It's all secondhand info from John Titor -- from Amane-san, isn't it?
Even if they're right about convergence...
Once you go to the Beta worldline, the 'me' that your brain perceives will die.
Why can't the world your brain perceives be different from the world my brain perceives?
Um, let me give you an easy example...
If I want to take the train from Akiba to Yokohama, which route should I use?


Kurisu: It's just an example. Geez.
You choose to take the Yamanote Line to Tokyo Station, then transfer to the Tokaido Main Line for the rest of your trip.
Another person -- say, Hashida-san -- might decide to take the Keihin Tohoku Line for some reason.
...I like to use my imagination too, sometimes.
But where's the proof that there's only one world?
And if Reading Steiner is what you say, then it means that your subjective experience influences the memories of every single human being.
But there are no gods in reality.
It's just your brain making you believe that it does.
Let's say you choose the worldline where I die. That doesn't mean I have to do the same.
Even if your perspective shifts to the Beta worldline, my perspective might remain here.
But there's a chance I'm right.
So you have nothing to worry about.
The problem is that you don't want to let me die, right?
The same is true of attractor fields.
In other words...
You really don't have to worry about me, Okabe. It would just hurt my pride if you did.

Okabe: Don't say it like that.

Kurisu: Your phone's ringing.

Okabe: Oh, yeah. It's Mayuri.

Kurisu: Answer it. I don't mind.

Okabe: 
...Hello?
Mayuri?
What's wrong?


Okabe: 
There's... nothing wrong.
...Black Tortoise, Vermilion Bird, Blue Dragon, and White Tiger.
What!? I never...!

Kurisu: What did Mayuri say?
You're such a wimp. I'm disappointed in you.

Okabe: How are you a burden!? Don't say things like that, dammit!

Kurisu: A burden, huh...
Then you should tell her that.
Okabe.
I'm sure she has a lot to say.

Okabe: Did something good happen?

Mayuri: Oh... gotta be careful, then. But you know, I'm sure that Mr. Illusion Kidhugger--
I'm sure he's not a bad guy.
I felt so happy there.
You know, I haven't talked to Okarin much lately.
But you know, I don't want to be a burden on Okarin.
It's Okarin♪

Okabe: !

Kurisu: Okabe.
...Thinking.
...Oh, okay.

Okabe: Hey. It's raining.
Whoa!

Kurisu: Whew, what a surprise.
You should've warned me sooner. Even my underwear's soaked.
...!
Achoo!
I'm not stripping naked, if that's what you're suggesting! Your pervy tricks won't work on me!
Another word, and I'll make you eat your cerebral neocortex with ponzu sauce!
A storm like that shouldn't last long. Guess we'll just wait it out.
H-hey, get your own stair!
W-what?
...Don't look at me.

Okabe: Damn. Must have caught on something when we ran inside.

Kurisu: What are you talking about?
Yeah, yeah.
Give it here.
I happen to have a sewing kit with me. I'll stitch it up for you.
Something wrong with that?
Can't I be a domestic experiment-loving girl?
Relatively, maybe. Well, actually, I don't know the domesticity index for Japanese high school girls these days.
It's wet, so it's kinda hard to thread.
So you're saying I brought it with me because I somehow knew your coat was going to get ripped. Uh-huh.
And before you get the wrong idea, I'm not fixing your coat because I want to or anything, okay?
So now you're saying that I went back in time for the sole purpose of repairing your stupid lab coat. Uh-huh.
Ridiculous. Ridiculous! There. It's so important I said it twice. Comprendes?
What's that, sarcasm? All you do is complain.
Here.
Oh, and I hope you like the color. Because I have no idea which thread I used.
Achoo!
But it's wet.
...Have you made your decision yet?

Okabe: 

Kurisu: Sigh... You still haven't made up your mind?
You like Mayuri, don't you?
N-not that I'm doing it for you, okay!? I just want to save Mayuri, that's all.

Okabe: 

Kurisu: Anyway, these images are stuck in my head, like memories.
You have to save Mayuri.
...
Like the world ended...
I've been thinking.
What if I can't go with you? What if I'm the only one left behind?
Don't make promises you can't keep!
You asked me if I wasn't afraid.
...Of course I'm afraid.
Or maybe only you will disappear and everything else will stay the same.
Maybe... maybe... maybe!
But even so!
Jesus, it's cold!
Listen, Okabe.
No matter how you struggle, it's one or the other.
No buts. My answer won't change.
You can, and you must! There's no other way.
Is there another solution? There isn't, is there?
I don't want to live if it means sacrificing Mayuri!
Eh...?
Thank you. I know you're hurting for me.

Okabe: I'm sorry.

Kurisu: 
Well then.
The lab, of course. I need to dry my clothes. I wanna take a shower, too.
You stay here and soak for a while.

Mayuri: 

Okabe: Where are you going!?

Mayuri: Please, Okarin. I have to talk to her!

Kurisu: Thanks for coming to see me off.
Hm? Oh. Yeah, it does.
I was supposed to go back at the beginning of the month. But then I ran into a certain mad scientist, and ended up staying longer than planned.
There's nothing else I can help you with anyway. And I don't want to be a liability.

Mayuri: 

Kurisu: What's wrong, Mayuri? Are you feeling sick?

Okabe: C'mon, Mayuri.

Mayuri: 
Chris-chan!

Kurisu: You have to listen to us now, Mayuri.
Okabe. Don't ever let go of her again.
Thank god I'll never have to see your silly face again!

Mayuri: Don't go, Chris-chan! Please, don't go!

Kurisu: Don't follow me!
...Goodbye.
Promise me, Mayuri. Promise me you'll find happiness.

Okabe: Let's save the shaved ice for when we get to the lab. It's too hard to eat while walking.

Mayuri: Okarin?
Is that what it's called? You're so smart!
Um, I don't know who it was, but Mayushii feels like she had a very important friend.
And sometimes, I hear a voice.
The voice tells me to 'find happiness.'
I wonder if that voice is the reason Mayushii's with Okarin now...
I wonder who it was.
Oh... well, thanks, God!

Okabe: I won't give up. Ever!

Kurisu: Kuh!

Your stupidity is infuriating! Why can't you just do as I say!?
...!

Okabe: This time...

Kurisu: Hmph!
Kuh...
Goodbye. I don't expect we'll meet again, Hououin Kyouma.
Running away?

Okabe: Why...

Kurisu: Time leaping is just running away.
Running only makes it hurt more.
Like I said, you can't stay here.
Hey! Could you not talk about me like that? I'm perfectly fine.
Let's say we wanted to make a machine that could physically transport people through time. What would we need?
Who the hell's Christina!? I never said that!
I don't want to deny who I've been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today.
We may have created a monster here...
You said I was your friend, remember? You said I was important to you. That made me really... happy, I guess...
Once we're done upgrading the PhoneWave... I want you to come with me.
I want to be your strength.
Thank you. I know you're hurting for me.

Okabe: I...
Why does it have to be you? Why!?

Kurisu: Hey, Okabe.
Will you... remember me?
Eh? Y-you mean...
B-but... proof. I need proof. I can't come up with a formula otherwise!

...!
Eh!? Wh-what!?
...
Close your eyes!
...
...
Research shows that memories are harder to forget when coupled with intense emotions.

...eh?
W-why you... You're just a cherry boy!
So it wasn't your first...
Wha...
Th-then I guess there's no choice...
Mm...
Don't forget me...
mm...
It's too fast...
I could really use a word with Einstein right now.
Hey, Okabe.
...Well then.
...That was a joke.
Uh... no thanks.

Okabe: Sorry I couldn't go with you to Aomori...

Kurisu: But these two weeks were fun, in their own way.

Mayuri: Okarin...

Daru: Everything's set. One press of the enter key, and that data's gone.

Okabe: Victory is at hand!
With unimaginable brilliance and unwavering conviction, I have defeated our vast and powerful enemy and now stand triumphant on the field of Ragnarok!
The coming world... is the world I wished for!

Kurisu: --!
Goodbye.

Daru: Whoa, man. Are you really crying?

Okabe: I... I...
Phew. That's that.

Daru: Man, what a waste. That thing was worth a fortune.

Kurisu: I don't want to deny who I've been. Because even my failures are a part of who I am today.
Going to the past is possible right now. Look into the sky at night, and you can see how things were tens of thousands of years ago.

Suzuha: We're here.
I bought it in 1975, but it's not even three years old yet.
You hide! I'll provide a distraction.

???: Excuse me.

Okabe: !?
Kurisu...!

Kurisu: I heard a strange sound from the roof. Is that why the building shook just now?
Are you listening? You're sweating like crazy.
Hey!
Please answer my question!
Can you... what?
W-wait! Stop!

Okabe: Who the hell am I!? Someone who knows you for a fraud, that's who!

Nakabachi: S-someone throw that man out!

Okabe: Haah.

Kurisu: 
...I wanted to talk.

Nakabachi: 

Suzuha: Oh, one more thing. Watch out for Doctor Nakabachi.

Nakabachi: 
What is that?

Kurisu: I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel.
I'd like your opinion, Papa.

Nakabachi: 

Suzuha: It started with a race between the EU and Russia. Then America got involved, and things really went to hell.

Nakabachi: Did I ask you to write this?

Kurisu: Well... no, but...
If the thesis is published, you could have your revenge on the scientific community for shunning you--

Nakabachi: I wasn't shunned!
Those incompetent bastards were just jealous of my superiority. I was the one who gave up on them!

Kurisu: Please don't yell...
You read really fast, Papa. Just like I remember.

Nakabachi: Not bad.

Kurisu: You think so?
...What do you mean?

Nakabachi: What do I mean? I mean don't think you're special just because you got your plebeian thesis published in some magazine!

Kurisu: 
I'm sorry...
Um... we haven't seen each other in a while. There's a lot I want to talk about. You're living in Aomori now, right?
I think... my father hates me.

Nakabachi: Leave.

Kurisu: Eh...


Kurisu: I... I don't understand. Please calm--


Kurisu: 

Nakabachi: What did you say?

Kurisu: Ah!

Okabe: Stop!

Nakabachi: !?
Who the hell are you!?
You!
You'll pay for mocking me!

Okabe: Kuh!

Kurisu: Stop it, Papa!
Guh...!

Okabe: NAKABACHI!

Kurisu: NO!
Ah... guh...!

Okabe: wh...y...
Why...

Kurisu: I'm... sorry...
Haah... haah...

Suzuha: There must be something on. Something you need to see!

Female Reporter: Russian authorities announced today that a fire broke out on Russian Airlines Flight 801, en route from Narita to Moscow.

Okabe: Doctor Nakabachi!

Kurisu: You're stealing my work? I didn't think even you would do something like--

Suzuha: The fate of the future hangs on this mission.

Okabe: You must not reject the three weeks you spent drifting between worldlines.

Mayuri: Look! RaiNet!

Kurisu: Ah!
H-hey, you just came down from the--
Eh?
W-wait!

Mayuri: Ah, it's an Upa!

Presenter: Thank you all for coming to Doctor Nakabachi's Time Machine Press Conference.

Okabe: What are you afraid of, Hououin Kyouma?

Kurisu: I wanted to talk.

Nakabachi: What is that?

Kurisu: I heard you were giving a presentation on time travel.

Okabe: !?

Nakabachi: I wasn't shunned!

Kurisu: Please don't yell...
Um... we haven't seen each other in a while. There's a lot I want to talk about. You're living in Aomori now, right?

Nakabachi: Leave.

Kurisu: Eh...

Nakabachi: 
Is this pity!? How dare you!? You're supposed to be my daughter!

Kurisu: I... I don't understand. Please calm--

Nakabachi: I'll tell you why I called you here today. I wanted to show you my research, research beyond even what you can imagine!
But that brat in the lab coat ruined everything! I know you were laughing at me too, don't you deny it! How dare you treat your own father this way!?
You want my opinion? Fine, I'll give it to you.

Kurisu: You're... stealing it?

Nakabachi: What did you say?

Kurisu: Ah!

Nakabachi: Who do you think you're talking to!?

Okabe: Stop!

Nakabachi: You!
You're the brat who ruined my presentation!

Kurisu: Guh, gah hoh gah hoh gah hoh...

Nakabachi: What!?

Kurisu: Run away!

Okabe: What's wrong, Doctor Nakabachi? Aren't you going to kill me? Or have you lost your nerve?
Of course, a mere mortal can never slay a god such as I! Muhahaha!

Nakabachi: You little...!

Kurisu: No! Papa, stop!

Okabe: Ah, gaah, aaahh!
Haah, haah, gaha...

Nakabachi: N-now who's laughing... hehehehe... That's what you get for mocking me!
Hee...!

Okabe: You'll regret this, old man!

Kurisu: Lie down! I'll call an ambulance!

Okabe: I'm going to save you.

Kurisu: What--
----

Suzuha: Once we arrive, I'll probably disappear. I won't be able to thank you for bringing me to Steins Gate.

Nakabachi: This is an outrage! An outrage!! A fire!? How can that happen!?

Okabe: eh?

Kurisu: It's you!

Okabe: It's me. Why is she here? Reading Steiner didn't activate.
We meet again, Christina.

Kurisu: How many times do I have to tell you!? I'm not Christina, or your assistant or--
Huh? I... why did I say that?
